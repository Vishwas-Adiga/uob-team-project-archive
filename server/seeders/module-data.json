It will outline the key challenges that immunotherapy strategies have to overcome, such as immunological tolerance, and immune evasion and immunosuppression mediated by the tumour. The module will outline to students the range and different classes of antigenic targets that are currently a focus of immunotherapy, explaining advantages/disadvantages in relation to factors such as tumour selectivity, applicability to different tumours, and functional role in the tumour. This will include outlining the potential for next generation immunotherapy approaches to target personalised combinations of antigens. The module will also provide an overview of the tissue context in which cancer immunotherapy takes place, and the challenges that the tumour microenvironment presents (eg in terms of accessibility and immunosuppressive effects), but also the opportunities (eg specific antigenic targets). Finally, drawing on specific examples, the module will outline a range of current immunotherapy approaches, focusing on their scientific basis and clinical mode of action. A brief overview of clinical trial pathways and how they apply to immunotherapy modalities will be provided. Immunotherapeutic strategies covered will include antibody therapies, checkpoint blockade strategies, T cell /chimeric antigen receptor adoptive therapy, and cancer vaccines.

    "description": "Combinatorics is the study of discrete (often finite) structures that arise not only in areas of pure mathematics, but in other areas of science, for example computer science, statistical physics and genetics.  From ancient beginnings, this subject truly rose to prominence from the mid-20th century, when scientific discoveries (most notably of DNA) showed that combinatorics is key to understanding the world around us, whilst many of the great advances in computing were built on combinatorial foundations. The combinatorics half of this module starts by looking at na\u00efve set theory, introducing the notions of partitions, equivalence relations and the notion of countable and uncountable infinite sets.  Sophisticated counting techniques are developed before an introduction to the field of graph theory, which provides a mathematical framework for the study of both real-world and virtual networks.\\n\\nOne of the most powerful techniques of pure mathematics is that of abstraction, which allows deep relationships between apparently unrelated areas to become apparent.  Abstract algebra is a powerful example of this technique, abstracting notions of symmetry and the properties of arithmetic to reveal algebraic structures such as groups, rings and fields.  Despite their very abstract nature, these ideas have significant real world applications, for example in communication theory and internet security.  Using familiar examples of the natural numbers, real numbers and polynomials as motivation, the axioms for groups, rings and fields are introduced and basic properties of these structures are explored.  Elementary number theory, the Euclidean algorithm, and prime numbers are discussed.  \\n\\nUnderlying themes throughout this module are techniques of proof and the importance of mathematical writing\\n"

Societal change has provided a wealth of new opportunities alongside those that are better established, while coverage of such events gains greater momentum through social media. Yet questions still remain about the ways criminal engagement, victimisation and criminal justice treatment are unequally experienced. Students on this module will consider a variety of traditional and contemporary societal features, connecting them with crime and criminal justice systems in order to understand more about crime and society at a local, national and global level. The module will be divided into three key areas:  Initially this module will start by examining how crime is experienced and represented, including different social stratifications such as gender, age, class and ethnicity. The capacity of the existing criminal justice apparatus to provide an effective response in these diverse contexts will also be critically examined. This module will then take a contemporary turn, focusing on crime and criminal justice in the context of recent societal developments such as internet crime, crime and the media, human trafficking, substance misuse, crimes of everyday life and austerity. Finally, this module will consolidate previous content by raising broader questions about need, risk, rights, (in)justice and inequality."

    "description": "This module will introduce the students to the classical theories of crime, as well as exploring more contemporary analyses of these theories. It will examine a range of critiques the classical theories of crime have been subject to. The module will be divided into the following constituent parts:  \\n\\nFirstly, the module will begin with an overview of 'what is crime' by introducing the students to the overarching questions that run through criminological theory. For example, 'who defines what a crime is?', 'why is something a crime in one country but not in another?', 'why does it matter if an action is a crime or not?'.  \\n\\nThen, the module will introduce the students to the positivist theories of crime: biological positivism, psychological positivism, and sociological positivism. It is envisaged that one lecture will be used to introduce the original theory and the following lecture will then discuss how the theory was developed by later theorists. The third will then discuss the critiques of the theoretical approach in question. Therefore, for example, 3 lectures will be spent on biological positivism: one on Lombroso and Goring, one on alter applications by Dugdale and Goddard, and one on the critiques of this type of positivist explanations of crime.   \\n\\nThe module will then turn to the constructivist theories of crime. This part of the module will introduce the students to labelling theory and radical criminology (Marxism and post-Marxist theories such as Bonger and Chambliss). Again, one lecture will be used to introduce the theory in its original form, a second will be dedicated to more contemporary theorists and the final to critiques and limitations of the theory.   \\n\\nEach theory will be illustrated with examples drawn from modern history and current affairs in order to encourage the students to think about the real-life applicability of the theory in question. Documentaries, debates and news-stories will be used to bring each theory 'to life'.     \\n"

This gives them an opportunity to apply their learning, to understand their ability to make an impact on real-world problems, and to understand the reality of how change is made to happen.Research and communication are at the heart of this module. Students work with members of the LANS academic team and with the support and guidance of relevant external expertise. Typically, the module involves some whole group lectures/training and briefing sessions, and some small group work. The module trains students to work as model policy development teams responding to selected issues; typically associated with visits to local organisations. Students will respond to the feedback from external partners in the development of their policy paper. This gives students the opportunity to identify and develop creative solutions that represent benefit for a range of stakeholders, and to gain experience in working practically with a range of real-world agenda. Central to this module is the development of transferable skills, and the module provides opportunities for students to develop skills of: self-management (such as setting personal objectives, managing time and tasks and identifying and implementing personal learning strategies); learning skills  (such as independent study, library skills and other information gathering skills\\t); communication (such as fluency in writing and presenting a coherent argument); problem solving (such as conceptual thinking, identifying strategic options for study and evaluating the use of different approaches to an issue).; information technology (such as using IT and other technologies as research tools; accessing specialist sites relevant to assignments, and practising information retrieval) group work (such as negotiating shared objectives and outcomes, inter-group communication, and leadership of particular workstreams) presentation skills."

During the module we will explore topics such as the 'politics' of defining 'the Holocaust', policies of inclusion and exclusion in the Third Reich, Nazi eugenics and the 'racial state'; the 'Holocaust by bullets' and the role of the Einsatzgruppen in the occupied Soviet Union; the role of  the Judenr\u00e4te (Jewish councils) in German-occupied Poland; how 'the Holocaust' was understood differently from the perspective of victims and perpetrators, both at the time and with the benefit of hindsight; the 'grey zone' and whether it is possible to be both a victim and a perpetrator. \\n\\nThis module seeks to develop your ability to read texts (both written and visual) critically yet sensitively. In evaluating sources it is important to ask who produced them and why. We will analyse a range of primary sources, including written texts (in different genres, produced by a range of participants, for a variety of purposes), photographs, art, film, material/physical remains of sites; the challenges in 'reading' and/or interpreting them, and ongoing controversies over how they are used and 'misused'. \\n\\nThis is a challenging subject to study and the module includes some graphic written and visual material.

It provides the theoretical under-pinning for future study in both business communications and marketing, so that students understand and can apply theory to contemporary examples and cases. Teaching also draws on the professional experience of lecturers and guest lecturers. The module examines the importance of organisational communication in regional and global contexts in relation to internal and external stakeholders, business strategies and organisational structure. It examines changing communications technologies, audiences and stakeholder needs. Key building blocks for business communications, including corporate identity, image, and culture will be examined, including the role of visual identity. Students will be encouraged to apply learning to appreciate and understand the impact communications has on the everyday running of a business, from the efficacy of email to managing key stakeholder relationships, and the importance of both putting people at the heart of business communications and the perspective of the individual in an organisation.Alongside the focus on communications, the module builds on the corporate identity theme to develop study into the role of marketing in business strategy; its part in brand building and its relationship with how brand identity is built and communicated; how marketing links in with business communications; how it increasingly places the consumer at the heart of campaigns. Students will explore core components of marketing, including market research and buyer behaviour, market segmentation and positioning,  Throughout the module practical examples will be studied to understand the success and failure of both communications and marketing strategies, how the roles support each other, and how regional culture can impact global marketing positioning. It will provide students with the essential background to understand communications and marketing planning processes, and the communications mix. The ethics of communications, marketing and associated advertising and an introduction to the use of interactive and digital media are also module themes.  The module aims for students to grow their individual and group communications skills, with opportunities to develop and express creative responses to set tasks as a part of both formative and assessed learning. It provides the foundational knowledge and understanding for students to build on as they consider both Communications and Marketing based modules at a higher level from year 2."

    "description": "This non-credit bearing module will be used to timetable personal development sessions for students in year 1 of the Dentistry, such as academic and library skills, resilience training, personal tutoring and to encourage the development of skills critical for the students to achieve their full potential on the course. In addition, as a clinical programme, it will be used to capture clinical related material for induction and compliance and professionalism work. To achieve those goals, content will be focused on non-module specific skills acquired during the year. This will not require any additional assessment but emphasises and rewards engagement of students with these elements. The use of a portfolio within the Clinical Assessment and Feedback System will capture longitudinal monitoring.  Furthermore, it ensures that students are not progressing with deficiencies in their skills which could put them at a significant disadvantage in the following year.  Students shall normally be required to:  1. Attend, engage with and contribute to all identified compulsory teaching sessions. 2. Engage with their Personal Tutor during tutorials and reflect on the subject and transferable skills that they are developing with the aid of feedback that they have received.3. Engage with professional / clinical responsibilities and requirements.4. Demonstrate a reflective approach to teaching and practice through satisfactory completion of portfolio records."

This module breaks this tradition and gives an introduction to alternative views. It also provides students with a taste of different \u2013 sometimes less conventional - approaches. The different traditions of doing philosophy that can be discussed on this module include both different historical approaches (including Pre-Socratic and Classical Philosophy, Medieval Philosophy, Early Modern Philosophy, Post Kantian Philosophy) and traditions from different cultures (including Continental Philosophy and various traditions in  Eastern Philosophy, African and Latin American Philosophy). Because the module is research-led and because there are so many different traditions, each year the exact content will vary depending upon the module convenor. Normally, the module will focus on one or two traditions in depth. The aim of the module is to introduce to the students the historical and cultural contexts of the relevant traditions, their key figures and texts, and their main questions and central views."

    "description": "This module gives first year students on the BA Education a basic grounding in the discipline of philosophy of education. The module is divided into three blocks: (1) Key Concepts in Education examines the core concepts of education, learning, teaching, indoctrination, knowledge, rationality and intelligence; (2) The Aims of Education asks what children should learn and why, introducing students to influential ideas about worthwhile activities, forms of knowledge, critical thinking, vocational education, character education and child-centred education; and (3) Fairness, Freedom and Control considers key normative questions about the organisation, governance and distribution of education, initiating students into the debates about selective, private and faith-based education, access to higher education and equality of educational opportunity.Through each block students are introduced to work by major Western philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Rousseau, Dewey) and key figures in the sub-discipline of philosophy of education (Peters, Hirst, Dearden, White, Wilson, Carr, Siegel, Brighouse, Winch). By equipping students with a critical understanding of core educational concepts and theories, and an appreciation of the conceptual, epistemological and ethical problems with which philosophers wrestle, the module lays a foundation for more advanced work in educational studies in general and philosophy of education in particular."

Our towns and cities are constantly evolving and the need to manage this change in order to create much-improved urban environments is critical. The ongoing transformation of Birmingham City Centre is testament to the important role that planning can play. A key objective of this module is the understanding of how cities and planning should be understood today. It will examine the roots and the development of planning from its origins up to the present day.  This module goes on to explore the contemporary operation of the UK planning system and examines the tools that urban planners have at their disposal to help shape the built (and natural) environment.  Topics will cover the organisation and management of the planning system, public engagement, climate change, and other contemporary planning issues."

    "description": "Statistics, often regarded as distinct science rather than a branch of mathematics, is the study of data and uncertainty.  Statistical techniques allow us to make conclusions, such as whether or not living near electricity pylons is dangerous, from sets of data.  Statistics is also used in the design of effective experiments and in determining what data should be collected.  For example, statistical techniques might be used to determine the frequency with which aircraft components should be tested for safety.  Underlying these techniques is the assumption that these data are samples of a random variable that follows a probability distribution describing their behaviour. This module provides an introduction to probability and statistics.  Axiomatic probability theory, including Bayes' Theorem, is discussed briefly.  Key discrete and continuous probability modules (such as the binomial, Poisson and normal distributions) are introduced.  Properties of expectation and variance are discussed. The Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem are covered before basic statistical ideas, such as statistical inference and hypothesis testing are introduced.  Real world data are used to illustrate the theory."

Placements play a vital role in the professional development of pharmacy student. Pharmacy practice takes place in a wide range of settings, reflected in the diversity of experience provided to students in this component.   For each placement, detailed information about learning tasks and expectations will be provided to students and their supervisors. Supervisors will be involved in assessing student performance (and their reflection on performance) as at expected level or below expected level, but the overall assessment of the component is managed by the programme team based on input from supervisors across multiple placement sectors. In the hospital setting, students will be supervised by teacher / practitioner academics. In other settings, academics from the programme team will take a more active role in supporting supervisors.  Students will be supported in their development by academic staff and practitioners working in partnership with pharmacy professionals, patients, and the public. Students demonstrate and record their experiences and achievements in a professional ePortfolio that links professional experience with other Year 1 modules. This is built on in each subsequent year.  Every care is taken to ensure the quality and safety of learning experiences and compliance with the Code of Practice for placement learning."

The teaching will introduce students to psychology as a discipline, its core perspectives and methods.  Students will be supported to consider human development across the lifespan, covering development in childhood, adolescence and younger, middle and older adulthood.  Understanding individuals in the context of their life-span, and their experiences of normative and non-normative transitions will be canvassed.  Addressing issues of diversity and development will be integrated throughout the teaching sessions.  At all points teaching is directed towards supporting the use of psychology to think about and understand experiences of care and welfare, and students are encourageds to draw on their own previous learning and experiences to help them evaluate the theories explored in sessions.  The module particularly seeks to address the 'development' aspects of the Knowledge and Skills Statements in relation to both Adults and Children and Families Social Workers ."

    "description": "This module introduces a number of powerful ideas found in all area of mathematics and its applications that are broadly geometric in flavour.  Complex numbers, which turn out to underpin a profound unification of many ideas in mathematics, are introduced.  Vectors, which have both magnitude and direction, provide a natural way to describe lines and planes and are the appropriate language with which to model physical systems in mechanics.  Matrices provide both a convenient way to deal with large systems of linear equations and to transform vectors and coordinate systems.  This in turn leads to the theory of linear algebra and vector spaces.  The abstraction of the notion of a vector space is another powerful unifying theory that is found across mathematics, with applications in abstract group theory, video games and signal processing. Coordinate systems for the Euclidean plane are discussed and the standard theory of conic sections is developed. The module also introduces the fundamental proof technique of Mathematical Induction."

Lectures and seminars help to situate and contextualise the texts in relation, for example, to the identity and career of the anthropologists who wrote them; the development of the discipline of anthropology over time; the various scholarly debates with which they engage; and their reception (contemporary and subsequent). Strong emphasis is placed on the craft of ethnographic writing. Students examine ethnographic writing as a genre and consider different ways in which descriptive and analytical writing are woven together to build an argument. This requires thinking carefully about the nature of ethnographic evidence, the methodological underpinnings of anthropological research, the authors' positionality and related ethical considerations, and the ways in which other forms of evidence are drawn upon to support ethnographic observation. Students engage with broad anthropological concerns, such as the relationship between the particular and the general, and the ethics and politics of representation, through close engagement with the texts."

This module requires a pre -final year placement which is either Communications or Marketing Communications focused to further develop knowledge and skills, gained at intermediate level, in a workplace setting. The module is a final-year option, and the onus will be on students to find a placement, with the advice and assistance of the Business School and the University Careers Service where appropriate. This module allows students to apply theory to practice and develop the transferable skills underpinning the QAA skills benchmarks in a live working situation. This gives added value to students in terms of their employability. Hence, Advanced Communications Practice allows students to apply theory to praxis and gain an understanding of how theoretical models can be applied in the real world, whilst further developing the key communications skills that employers today are increasingly seeking.  The taught and reflective part of the module, post-placement at the commencement of the final year, enables students to analyse in depth working communications-based practices and assimilate wider and more advanced associated theoretical frameworks."

Abstraction allows us to view the results of specific calculations in a more generic setting.  This is a core objective of pure mathematics.  It means that a single theorem can be applied in many different mathematical situations. \\nThe primary algebraic objects are groups, rings and fields and these will be the main players in the algebra part of the module.   This second module builds on the first year algebra course, extending results and producing new ideas which help us gain a deeper understanding of the algebraic structures which govern mathematics.  The fundamental notions which will be introduced are substructures, structure preserving functions and quotient structures and the course will introduce these ideas illustrating them with numerous examples.\\nCombinatorics studies discrete mathematical structures.  These structures are very simple themselves, but they often give rise to incredibly complex problems that are beyond the capacity of current computers to solve.  Combinatorics is an essential component of many mathematical areas and also has important applications in Computer Science, Physics, Economics and Biology.\\nThe Combinatorics part of the module consists of three topics.  The first discusses advanced counting arguments, illustrating links to other areas of Mathematics.  The second consists of topics in Graph Theory.  There are many beautiful results in this area (e.g. the four colour theorem).  These results are easily accessible but often require surprising ideas.  The third topic builds on the previous two and deals with Combinatorial Algorithms and their efficiency, thus emphasizing links between Combinatorics and Computer Science."

Thus beyond the obvious fact of putting African, Black and Global South authors on the reading list, this module will introduce students to core concepts and theories in anticolonial, postcolonial, and decolonial scholarship, which they apply across their degree programmes and in their adult lives, to enhance their critical analysis of knowledge and power. The module will promote students' close reading skills through intensive weekly engagement with selected texts. But it will also provide points of connections into historical and contemporary struggles, from decolonisation in Africa and the Caribbean in the mid C20 to Rhodes Must Fall in present times."

Particular attention is paid to the process of transcription by RNA polymerase, the role of sigma factors in controlling transcription specificity how environmental signals are transmitted across the cytoplasmic membrane, and the way that sequential expression of sigma factors determines cascades of gene expression during differentiation. This module introduces students to (i) the different levels of regulation during gene expression in bacteria and the mechanisms whereby control is exerted (ii) current methods for studying gene expression and regulation.  It also provides opportunities for students to prepare work based on original scientific literature, and to present the material through formal delivery and informal discussion.

We will then analyse how biomolecules (enzymes) can regulate the chemical reactions that occur in cells and how these can be targeted by drugs, for example to treat disease. Finally, we will explore the electrical properties of nerve cells and how information is transmitted around the body. Along the way, we will learn the operation of key physical instruments used in the life-sciences, for example different types of microscopes and also touch on biological methods such as genetic engineering and cell culture."

So how can we maintain brain health across the lifespan? How do we help older adults to develop and maintain functional ability and cognitive wellbeing? How can evidence from psychological and human neuroscience research inform societal policy, to enable people to be and do what they value throughout their lives?This module will cover:- age-related changes in cognition- structural and functional brain changes- influences of lifestyle factors and interventions- pathological ageing and age-related diseases"

    "description": "On 23 June 2016 the British electorate voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. For the first time Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which enables a member state to leave the EU, has been invoked. Leaving the EU however does not mean that we can ignore the EU; it means that, as the UK moves from a position of 'Doing Business in the EU', to 'Doing Business with the EU', more than ever there is a need to be informed about the EU. Introducing students to the economic and political dynamics of the European Union, the module aims to inform students about the European Union, its history, its rationale, its institutional structures and their role and functions and policy competences.   One the drivers to the formation of the EU is neo-liberal thought on the need to create a free market in Europe by removing both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in order to secure economic growth and development of the EU economy and its member states and regions. In Semester I, the module accordingly first reviews the state of the EU economy, to consider how well the EU economy is doing and in comparison to the global economy. Students then learn about the history of the EU and consider the rationales for the establishment of the EU, in exploring theories of integration. The module examines the rationale for the customs union and the single market, and the regulatory regime inherent in these questioning whether these are a burden on businesses. It then looks at the nature of the EU and its institutions. It then turns to explore some of the policy competences of the EU, among them, competition policy, industrial policy, EMU, the Common Agricultural Policy and Environmental Policy, in order to consider the benefits to businesses of being a member of the EU, and which the UK is foregoing on its exit from the Union, this depending on the trade deal that the UK manages to achieve in the Brexit negotiations. The module explores the options that the UK could take on leaving the EU and whether it could remain a member of the Single Market and the Customs Union, in consideration of the implications of this for the principle of the 'four freedoms' and for future trade between the EU and other trading partners and what it means for businesses."

    "description": "This module combines and integrates the students' first hospital experience with continuing experience in community based and clinical science teaching which supports them both. The module builds on the foundation provided by the mainly theoretical learning during the first two years and on their initial clinical experience in primary care. The module itself provides a transition into clinical learning, application of foundation knowledge and assimiliation of specialist clinical experience that continues into subsequent years and will prepare students for the medical licensing assessment.\\n\\nStudents have two hospital placements (30 weeks in all) \u2013 one in each semester and there is a Head of Academy who oversees the provision of experience in each hospital. For each placement, students are assigned to a combined medical / surgical teaching firm which provides supervision and formal / informal small group teaching. Following a generic introductory period of 4 weeks for all students on placement, students are subdivided to provide experience in specialist clinical areas for a full semester.  Students switch specialist areas in the second semester to provide experience to conditions not previously exposed to. However, independent learning is vital in the hospital setting in which learning is often determined by the particular patients and problems present, rather than by a set timetable. Through their independent interaction with patients, students gain confidence and competence in communication and physical examination. They learn about the common problems presenting to doctors in medicine and surgery and the ways in which they are managed. They also develop some understanding of the thinking processes that underlie diagnosis and the way in which management decisions are made and start to develop the skills in these areas that they require.\\n\\nIn doing this they are utilising, applying and building on the knowledge of clinical sciences delivered in large part through a series of lectures in blocks in the Medical School introducing them to the fundamentals of pathology, clinical chemistry, haematology, infection and immunity.\\n\\nIn their community-based medicine (CBM) placement, students continue to observe and participate in GP consultations, but also take on a 'study caseload' in which they have regular contact through the year with a number of patients in different categories (e.g. a woman at the end of pregnancy; a baby; someone with a chronic condition). The CBM experience in relation to patients with chronic and acute conditions links with hospital experience and helps students to retain a more rounded view of the patient journey.\\n"

    "description": "When mathematical modelling is used to describe physical, biological, chemical or other phenomena, one of the most common results is either a differential equation or a system of differential equations, which, together with appropriate boundary and/or initial conditions, describe the situation.  These differential equations can be either ordinary (ODEs) or partial (PDEs) and finding and interpreting their solution lies at the heart of applied mathematics.  This module develops the theory of differential equations with a particular focus on techniques of solving both linear and nonlinear ODEs.  Fourier series, which arise in the representation of periodic functions, and special functions, which arise in the solution of PDEs such as Laplace's equation that models the flow of potential, are also introduced.   A number of the classical equations of mathematical physics are solved."

A small proportion of students choose to stay at home for either personal or financial reasons.The type of elective project and therefore the nature of the report vary hugely. Projects may involve data collection or other research study (e.g. anthropological) but are often simply clinical and/or educational experience. Data collection reports follow the standard structure for a scientific report with details of method, analysis, conclusions etc. and other scientific studies would follow their own paradigm.  Where students are undertaking a clinical or educational experience, they are required to produce a reflective report."

This module also demonstrates that the results and concepts of other branches of mathematics (like the fixed point theorem, convexity, duality) have practical interpretation and use.  \\n\\nThe second half of this module explores multicriteria or multiobjective optimisation where several conflicting objectives have to be optimised simultaneously: stock portfolios have to be chosen such that the portfolio maximises the return and simultaneously minimises the risk; health care has to be managed such that the service is efficient yet not too costly; hazardous material has to be transported such that risk as well as costs incurred are minimal; bridges and buildings have to be designed such that they can be built cheap but still with maximum stability etc. As such, multicriteria problems are of prime importance for decision makers in the private as well as the public sector. This module brings together various ideas from geometry and analysis in studying solutions and solution methods for multicriteria problems in management and science.\\n"

    "description": "The module explores the diverse range of harms associated with genocide and mass atrocities, placing them in an historical, social and political context, and subjecting them to analytical frameworks which serve to illuminate their causes and societal impact.  This process of examination allows students to reflect on how societies and governments can best respond to the issues of individual and collective responsibility, social and transitional conceptions of justice, and the punishment and prevention of genocide.  Students taking the module are encouraged to think about how people 'heal' in the aftermath of genocide while societies continue to retain a central awareness of the social costs of mass killing, these societies and the international community can learn from the past and progress without neglecting the associated harms of genocide.   \\n\\nTo facilitate a comprehensive understanding of genocide and mass atrocities the module will develop in four interconnected phases: 1) the history of genocide and the establishment of the Genocide Convention; 2) illustrative case studies (colonial forms of genocide and indigenous societies; the Armenian genocide, the Jewish Holocaust, the Cambodian killing fields, Rwanda, and Darfur); 3) theoretical approaches; 4) responding to genocide, legal and social mechanisms of justice and prevention (ad hoc and permanent tribunals; truth and reconciliation commissions).  This approach to teaching and learning provides students with an in-depth understanding of how genocidal movements take root at the social level, gaining legitimacy through political actors, galvanised by supremacist ideologies, leading to 'ordinary people' participating in acts of mass abuse, torture and killing.  \\n\\nOn completing the module students will be able to apply an awareness of genocide and mass atrocities to contemporary examples of societal conflict and war (as evidenced in Iraq and Syria, for example) and evaluate the degree to which these events constitute acts of genocide.  Through this process of evaluation students can also critically assess the potential limitations of the Genocide Convention as a triggering mechanism for international responses to mass killing and consider alternative approaches suitable to preventing further loss of life and the avoidance of irrevocable social fragmentation.  \\n\\n"

    "description": "This module addresses the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of the geographies of childhood and education. It examines children and young people's everyday lives and educational experiences in the context of urban, social, cultural and environmental change. Together, the related sub-disciplines of Children's Geographies and Geographies of Education have bought increased academic and policy attention to the importance of understanding children and young people's everyday lives.  The module will draw on contemporary research projects, literature and academic and policy debates about the socio-spatial lives of children and the educational spaces in which they spend much of their lives. It will also assess the ways in which, in turn, geographical research on education relates with the teaching of geography and children's learning about spatial skills in the classroom.  Importantly the module will address the diversity of childhood experiences, offering distinctions between and within majority and minority worlds.  Thinking geographically about children and young people's use of environment, education, positionality, culture, participation, agency and citizenship is key to exploring the social constructions of childhood."

It includes a focus on Russia's national identity, issues of migration, the impacts on society of economic transformation, the legacies of the Soviet past, marginalisation, and the exercise of political control over space. The module will consolidate and develop theoretical themes introduced in Years 1 and 2 concerning political and socio-economic geography. These will be related case-studies that are drawn from the lecturers' own research on Russia. The programme aims to combine concepts with real-world examples. It seeks to overcome prevailing stereotypes on a country that is often misunderstood and misrepresented in the West.

    "description": "This specialist module explores concepts and case studies related to the geopolitics of current global challenges. The module draws on political geography, critical geopolitics, and cognate areas, to explore some of the most important geopolitical processes of our time, focusing on the Middle East, Russia and Cities. The module adopts a deliberately wide notion of geopolitics encompassing a variety of scales and their interactions, from the regional and transnational through the national to the urban, the everyday and intimate. The module has three strands of lectures and seminars: on the Middle East, on Russia and on urban geopolitics. These will equip students with a broad knowledge of current global geopolitical challenges and concepts, applying them to relevant examples. The module blends lectures and seminars, where students will deepen their knowledge of and engage in learned debate about a range of specific cases and/or ideas. The module is subdivided in lecture blocs/strands:Strand 1. Imaginative Geographies and the Middle East This first strand looks at the Middle East in the 21st Century, from the 'war on terror' through the Arab Spring to the war in Syria. In particular, we'll be interested in how understandings and representations of the region have influenced policies and interventions led by western powers since the turn of the century. Specific points of focus will be the 'war on terror', the 'Arab Spring' and the Syria war.Suggested reading: Said, E. (1979) Orientalism. London: VersoStrand 2. Geopolitics, Identity, and Russia This strand examines how Russia is interpreted through the lens of geopolitics. It will introduce and critique both classical and critical geopolitics in order to explore Russia's fraught relationship with the West, its contested borders, relations with its neighbours, and the influence of Eurasianism in defining Russia's place in the world.Suggested readings: Toal, G.

Cities, global politics, and conflict This strand explores why and how cities are geopolitically significant in contemporary global challenges. We will study how and why cities have become strategic terrains as well as targets of regular and irregular warfare, and with what legacies.Suggested readings: Graham, Stephen, ed. (2004).

The module introduces the core of international trade theory and uses these models as the basis for further policy analysis.The prevailing challenge is to explain the determinants of national comparative advantage, by considering the major traditional theories, including relative differences in labour productivity, factor endowments, production functions and factor specificity followed by more recent explanations of trade patterns such as differences in market structures, the effects of imperfect competition, and scales in production, as well as the theory of trade policy. Relevant empirical evidence relating to these theories and to what degree it provides support for them, will also be investigated.Following from the theory-based analysis, the module is devoted to the analysis of government trade policies. Topics covered include strategic trade policy (which analyses trade policy under imperfect competition) and political economy (which analyses how trade policy is determined under both median voter and lobbying models). This is followed by examining global and regional moves towards free trade and how these interact with each other. Finally the module considers the motivation for foreign direct investment (FDI), how trade affects growth, and controversies in trade policy. While the focus is mainly on understanding the theory underlying policy choices, examples are used to illustrate the ideas."

    "name": "LH Linear Algebra & Linear Programming",
    "description": "Linear algebra grew out of the development of techniques at the start of the 18th century by Leibniz, Cramer and Gauss to solve systems of linear equations.  Cayley developed matrix algebra in the middle of the 19th century and the definition of a vector space was made by Peano at the end of the 19th century, resulting in a theory of linear transformations and vector spaces in the early 20th century.  Linear algebra is not only fundamental to both pure and applied mathematics, but also has applications ranging from quantum theory to Google search algorithms. This module develops the theory of vector spaces introduced in Vectors, Geometry & Linear Algebra, covering eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials, inner products, and diagonalization.\\n\\nIf linear algebra grew out of the solution of systems of linear equations, then linear programming grew out of attempts to solve systems of linear inequalities, allowing one to optimise linear functions subject to constraints expressed as inequalities.  The theory was developed independently at the time of World War II by the Soviet mathematician Kantorovich, for production planning, and by Dantzig, to solve complex military planning problems.  Koopmans applied it to shipping problems and the technique enjoyed rapid development in the postwar industrial boom.  The first complete algorithm to solve linear programming problems, called the simplex method, was published by Dantzig in 1947 and in the same year von Neumann established the theory of duality. In 1975, Kantorovich and Koopmans shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work and Dantzig's simplex method has been voted the second most important algorithm of the 20th century after the Monte Carlo method. Linear programming is a modern and immensely powerful technique that has numerous applications, not only in business and economics, but also in engineering, transportation, telecommunications, and planning.\\n"

The focus of the negotiated learning will therefore primarily be to undertake research into potential careers, normally focusing on one or two potential career areas. Students will frame goals from the following career pathways:\\nClinical academic/ research \\nClinical leadership/management \\nSpecialist or advanced clinical practice\\nOther nursing careers (examples could include international nursing, nursing press/journalism) \\n \\n\\nModule Content/Strategies: \\n\\nStudents will be exposed to a range of nursing careers at the beginning of year 3. Students will develop their understanding of adult and experiential learning theory, self-assessment, critical reflective writing and CV/ portfolio development. Workshops on writing personal goals and learning outcomes and developing learning contracts will be held in semester 1. Students will then develop a learning contract with a set of personal learning outcomes to be achieved through independent learning to be presented for feedback and then for signed agreement by the end of semester 1. Students will engage in scheduled online forums and discussions and will be encouraged to deposit useful information into a shared student repository of career information and resources. \\n\\nUnder learning contract, students may negotiate to include an independent elective shadowing experience, short internship or programme of career development (e.g. a research or leadership development programme) with an agreed /named supervisor. Developmental experiences may also include attendance at relevant seminars, conferences, job fairs etc. Students may draw upon voluntary or other experiences which have developed or are developing their personal strengths in relation to career aspirations (for example previous elective, acting as student ambassador, student representation, roles in clubs and societies) Within the negotiated contract, the maximum period allowed for any one internship, shadowing experience or developmental programme is four weeks. Negotiated experience must not take place during/conflict with other year 3 theoretical or placement commitments. \\n\\nDepending on their anticipated goals, students may design and develop their contract as an individual or as a group. For example, if students are undertaking a short developmental programme together this may be developed in a group contract. Students will use a critically reflective e-portfolio to record their learning and achievement and this will form the assessment of the module. \\n"

Topics may include (1) initial value problems for ordinary differential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations; (2) boundary and initial-boundary value problems for partial differential equations. The basic explicit Euler method, its variants like the implicit Euler method, the trapezoidal rule, and multi-step methods will be introduced to numerically solve ordinary differential equations. For the numerical methods for partial differential equations, we will introduce finite difference methods, finite volume methods and finite element methods. The fundamental concepts of truncation errors, consistency, convergence and stability are studied. Discretization and solution methods are covered for each type of differential equations. The implementation and application of numerical methods will be performed in MATLAB."

They construct their own arguments and positions, and present both the exegetical and evaluative material in clear, concise English. Although the module is Level H, teaching begins in the summer term of Stage 2 (and coincides with that offered as part of the 20-credit module, Philosophical Project (09 21805): during his period students attend (i) two lectures on philosophical methodology aimed to help them to chose a topic and to begin work on it; (ii) a workshop in which they present draft versions of their work and work in groups to address problems encounter; and  (iii) a more conventional (optional) seminar at towards the very end of term at which they are have an opportunity to raise and discuss further issues with each other and the module convenor. During this period they write a short research proposal (1,500 words max. \u2013 50% longer than that written by students on the 20 credit version). This is submitted in Week 3/4 of the first term of their final year, at which point they are assigned a supervisor who gives feedback on the proposal. (The proposal is an exclusively formative assessment.) Over the course of the final year they have 4 or 5 further meetings with the supervisor, who reads and comments on work-in-progress and provides help and advice on the dissertation process. We do not anticipate that many Joint Honours students will take this module (and only those who are taking at least 80 credits in Philosophy at LH are permitted to do so) but amongst those who do, if any have unusually heavy exam commitments in Stage 2 in their other subject they are permitted to skip some or all of the Summer term sessions, and if any do so, an extra couple of seminars/tutorials are provided at the start of the first term of their final year."

In doing so it advances the notion of science as a socially constructed endeavour in analysing the evidence base on conflicting policy issues. The module is structured around critical questions including: how do environmental politics/environmental policy challenges come about? What are the processes by which environmental politics emerge/are defined? Who is involved in making decisions, and how are values and knowledges mobilized to underpin them? How can we reconcile conflicts between different forms of rationality with the need to be environmentally accountable and responsible?

    "description": "This module provides an introduction to public economics\u00ac, which is the positive and normative study of the role of government in the economy through taxation, expenditure and regulation. The module's aims are to explain the behaviour of government, the responses of individuals, households and firms to that behaviour and the welfare effects of the government's actions. The module will explore topics related to the two main reasons for government intervention in the economy: allocation of resources, when private market outcomes are Pareto inefficient because of either market failure or the underutilisation of resources (e.g. labour); and distribution of resources, when private market outcomes lead to socially undesirable distributions of income or wealth. This exploration may include studying the notions of efficiency and incidence, which can be used to frame the effects of government intervention on the allocation and distribution of resources in the economy and which are the main measures that economists use to evaluate the welfare effects of government policy.  The first part of the module will provide an introduction to public economics, including an overview of the theoretical and empirical tools of analysis that are part of the public economist's toolkit. The second part of the module will study issues related to market failures and social insurance. Topics related to market failures may include externalities and public goods, political economy, cost benefit analysis, state and local government expenditures and specific problems and solutions related to education. Other topics may include social insurance, social security, unemployment insurance, disability insurance and income distribution and welfare programs.  The third part of the module will cover taxation in theory and practise, including an overview of what taxation means and how it works. Topics may include the equity implications of taxation, including tax incidence; inefficiencies of taxation and their implications for optimal taxation as well as taxes on labour supply, savings, risk taking, wealth, businesses and consumption."

    "description": "Launched in the centenary year of the start of the First World War, this module offers students the opportunity to encounter the shock of the war - its historical, cultural and psychological enormity and incomprehensibility - as it was expressed by writers who experienced it and lived through its aftermath, as well as to explore and critically analyse the continuing significance of the War and its cultural mythology within literary history from 1914 to the present day. They will be exposed to a range of moments in the articulation and representation of the War, from the voices preserved in the poetry of 1914-18, across the curious imaginative silence of the early post-war years to the flood of memoirs and autobiographical prose fiction that appeared in the mid to late 1920s, to the historical representations that began to appear from the 1960s, to our contemporary moment of remembrance and memorialisation as marked by 2014. Framed by a reading of Timothy Findley's historical novel The Wars (1977), the module will encourage students to reflect upon the ways in which they themselves approach, represent and 'remember' the War in the act of historical research and literary criticism. \\n\\nOther texts taught are likely to include a selection from the following novels, memoirs, plays and poetry collections, alongside letters, diaries and other ephemera: poetry from the trenches and the home front [from The First World War Poetry Digital Archive at http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/ and Tim Kendall, Poetry of the First World War: An Anthology (OUP 2013), and Catherine Reilly, Scars Upon My Heart: Women's Poetry and Verse of the First World War  (Virago, 2006)], Rebecca West, Return of the Soldier (1918), Ford Madox Ford, No More Parades (1925), R.C. Sheriff, Journey's End (1928), Ernest Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms (1929), Frederic Manning, The Middle Parts of Fortune (1929), Robert Graves, Goodbye to All That (1929), Richard Aldington, Death of a Hero (1929), Erich Maria Remarque, All Quiet on the Western Front (1929; 1929 Wheen translation), Helen Zenna Smith, Not So Quiet ...

Governance is defined loosely as the formal and informal structures and processes that encourage and accommodate representation by societal groups in decision-making and decision-taking. The module considers different ways in which resource production and its distributional effects are represented, managed, legitimized and contested through complex relations between state, industry and society. Through a variety of case studies, it explores the resulting implications for accountability, transparency, social acceptability, representation and justice, and for power relations locally, nationally and globally. It also considers various obstacles and barriers as well as tools and procedures that might enable wider participation of actors in resource governance in future. Crucially, developing effective forms of resource governance is a process that cuts across multiple geographical scales and political-administrative boundaries, requiring targeted interventions to enable effective participation."

    "name": "LH Responses to Global Environmental Change",
    "description": "Since its inception, life on earth has had to adapt to changing environmental conditions, either through phenotypic plasticity (across rapid, diurnal or seasonal timescales), or through evolution (across multiple generations).  This module investigates how organisms detect and respond to variable environments, including anthropogenic (human-made) change, and reviews the different molecular signalling pathways and physiological mechanisms underpinning adaptation to changing conditions.  Examples are provided from a range of organisms, but with a specific focus on plants and insects. Case studies highlight different research techniques employed in examining responses to environmental change, as well as how to potentially manipulate these responses in order to develop mitigation strategies/enhance resilience at species, population and ecosystem levels, as well as for food security.The main aims of this module are to provide students with information, guidance, and access to resources, that will allow them to:(a) Gain an in-depth understanding of how organisms respond and adapt to changes in their environment.(b) Recognize that the term \u0022environment\u0022 covers a continuum of spatial scales from molecular environments within cells, to broad-scale geographic environments and climatic zones.(c) Appreciate that adaptation to environmental change for an individual organism is transient and occurs across a temporal spectrum of seconds to seasons.  For species, adaptation is long-term, but not fixed/permanent, and occurs across a timescale of generations. (d) Interpret the potential impact of climate change on species (including crops), communities and ecosystems, as well as the provision of food security.(e) Become effective independent learners, capable of interpreting and critically analysing the scientific literature to help formulate and express their own ideas and develop mitigation strategies against the negative impacts of climate change and extreme environments."

    "description": "Marketing is sometimes seen as antithetic to positive societal and sustainable goals, but applying its principles can also serve to effectively promote societal outcomes. Concepts such as responsible, social and sustainability marketing are at the forefront of current marketing thinking and practice, and the current module aims to expose the marketing practitioners of tomorrow to a range of responsible marketing practices. In doing this, the module aims to encourage students to develop their own, well-informed understanding of, and position on, being and becoming a responsible marketer and consumer.    More specifically, the module will examine societal and environmental problems marketers currently face by addressing the interrelationship between marketing, public policy, and social and environmental values. These concepts are broadly underpinned by the idea that companies and consumers must behave ethically and sustainably in their attempts to address the social and environmental issues currently threatening the future wellbeing of societies and environmental systems across the globe (Belz and Peattie, 2012).   Topics include responsible marketing, social marketing and public policy, sustainability marketing, as well as ethical philosophy and frameworks that facilitate the analysis of responsibility issues in marketing and consumption. Learning and teaching within this module will be fostered through a combination of lectures, case studies, quizzes, videos, research-led group discussions, and blogs. It is expected that students actively contribute to, and participate in, classroom and online debates; the aim is to foster a collaborative, non-judgemental and inclusive learning environment."

M. Thackeray, Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James. The set primary works for the module will be studied alongside a rich array of contemporary print sources, nineteenth-century history and historiography, and modern critical and theoretical approaches to historical fiction.There will be a recurring emphasis on the writing of wars, revolutions and popular uprisings, and on concomitant questions of national and historical rupture, as well as on the efforts of fictional writings to restore or make up for past losses, to bridge or jump over (or side-step) ruptures in the texture of past time. Related topics for consideration will include: the impact of human history on places and ecosystems, the interactions of oral and written history, the romance of antiquarian scholarship, literary biography and book-history, superstition and the persistence of the supernatural, the progress of civilization and the costs of that progress, and the recreational appropriation of the past as a field for adventure or a tourist destination. Throughout the module we will be asking how nineteenth-century historical fictions attempt to register the ideological and stylistic differences of the past while also bringing it into imaginative reach of the present."

    "description": "This module will be a comprehensive introduction to sleep itself and the links between sleep and several areas of health.   Sleep is essential for good overall functioning, and there is wide evidence supporting the view that sleep has an impact on mental and physical health, across the life span. For instance, sleep is a process that is mainly regulated and controlled by the brain, and is strongly implicated in all psychological process, including memory, emotion, perception, imagination, thinking and reasoning. In addition, sleep has a strong impact on both mental health and health more generally. However, understanding this link is difficult because these are complex, multi-faceted and dynamic processes. Not only is it likely that different types of mental or physical health problems affect sleep patterns differently, but the aspects of sleep that have a greater impact on mental and/or physical health problems may also be different.   The module will start with an introduction to relevant issues in sleep, including common methods for its classification, and techniques used to understand the neurophysiological basis of this classification. The evolutionary purpose of sleep will be discussed, before moving on to links between sleep and health. We will first introduce the evidence linking sleep and mental health, followed by the latest research on sleep and physical health, and sleep and cognition. The focus will then shift  The focus will then shift to discuss the development of sleep in childhood and across the lifespan. The module will end with the latest research on sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders.  Overall, we will aim to provide students with a solid understanding of what is currently known about the importance of sleep for health across the life span.

Wetlands are disappearing but, in the past, they were highly productive and heavily exploited landscapes. Most of us have lost our connection to wetlands, but this course will re-introduce you to the history and lifeways of wetlands from prehistory to modern day conservation.  This module will provide an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the past. It will survey wetland reconstruction, exploitation, archaeology, history, drainage and reception, and will explore the methods by which we study them. From prehistoric human sacrifice to Roman exploitation and post medieval landscape reclamation, the study of wetlands is augmented by the exceptional preservation that these environments can offer.  Although wetlands may seem like marginal places, for the study of the past the high levels of preservation of sedimentary records of the natural environment, alongside exceptional preservation of cultural and human remains, mean that they have much to tell us about the whole landscape. This extends from what and how people farmed, through to the issues of environmental and climate change that are so prevalent today."

What is the probability that Birmingham City will win the FA Cup this season? Will it rain today? What is the probability that I will win the lottery this week? Statistical theory and methods are fundamental to our understanding of such uncertainty, and are an increasingly sought after skill. For example, Google uses statistics to improve their search algorithms; medical research uses statistics to design and analyse clinical trials evaluating whether a new cancer treatment is effective; and actuarial and economic teams use statistics to make accurate predictions about future risks and outcomes. This module presents a parallel development of statistical theory and methods, building on the introductory material in Probability & Statistics. Topics covered include classical linear models, with an introduction to the analysis of variance; basic methods for handling discrete data; further work in the theory of probability distributions; and some aspects of the theory of estimation and hypothesis testing. In the computing sessions, a statistical package is used to illustrate the application of statistical methods to the analysis of some typical data sets."

Lectures will initially recap the basic concepts underpinning embryonic and adult stem cells, and recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of pluripotency and cell differentiation, before exploring the molecular mechanisms that underpin differentiation, iPS cell and 'direct' reprogramming. We will also discuss (i) key categories of adult stem cells and their contribution to normal tissue maintenance and/or disease, and (ii) current progress in developing cell based therapies for therapeutic use, both to address specific conditions and in the context of tissue engineering.   Small group teaching will reinforce these concepts, but will primarily focus on experimental aspects in this field (i.e. the techniques used, and interpreting and presenting these data), by discussing scientific journal articles. Practicals will give an insight into cell culture, and the experimental manipulation of cells down specific differentiation pathways and their characterisation"

The course examines the relationship between the state, markets, informal economic activity, personal life and social relations. Topics which may be covered include labour geographies, regional unemployment, transformations of the welfare state, discrimination and marginalisation in work, welfare, migrant experience and social policy. The aim of the course is to demonstrate how geographers think about how dominant global economic processes shape unpaid and paid work, welfare, migration, formal and informal work spaces and alternative economies.  Fairness, justice, rights, coping, resilience, responsibility are concepts which underpin the course. Central to these issues is a politics concerning whose life and work is valued. You will also consider how spatial inequalities are shaped by issues of political and media representation, collective organising and shifts in social policy. The course will be useful to students considering a career in policy-making, non-governmental/voluntary organisations, social enterprises and the public sector."

Examples of dialogue between writing and painting may include historical novels that imagine and narrate the creative lives of artists; poetry and prose that respond -- with ekphrasis, critical re-description, or appreciation -- to artworks; and poems and paintings that emerge from collaborations between poets and painters, in contexts such as the mid-twentieth-century New York School. We will trace theoretical ideas such as the modernist assertion of medium specificity or the separation of the arts or the question arising from visual culture studies, \u0022What Do Pictures Want?\u0022 What might seem a formalist topic takes on political urgency in, for example, textual responses to J.

    "description": "Combinatorics is the study of discrete (often finite) structures that arise not only in areas of pure mathematics, but in other areas of science, for example computer science, statistical physics and genetics.  From ancient beginnings, this subject truly rose to prominence from the mid-20th century, when scientific discoveries (most notably of DNA) showed that combinatorics is key to understanding the world around us, whilst many of the great advances in computing were built on combinatorial foundations. The combinatorics half of this module starts by looking at na\u00efve set theory, introducing the notions of partitions, equivalence relations and the notion of countable and uncountable infinite sets.  Sophisticated counting techniques are developed before an introduction to the field of graph theory, which provides a mathematical framework for the study of both real-world and virtual networks.\\n\\nOne of the most powerful techniques of pure mathematics is that of abstraction, which allows deep relationships between apparently unrelated areas to become apparent.  Abstract algebra is a powerful example of this technique, abstracting notions of symmetry and the properties of arithmetic to reveal algebraic structures such as groups, rings and fields.  Despite their very abstract nature, these ideas have significant real world applications, for example in communication theory and internet security.  Using familiar examples of the natural numbers, real numbers and polynomials as motivation, the axioms for groups, rings and fields are introduced and basic properties of these structures are explored.  Elementary number theory, the Euclidean algorithm, and prime numbers are discussed.  \\n\\nUnderlying themes throughout this module are techniques of proof and the importance of mathematical writing."

  {
    "name": "LI Algebra & Combinatorics 2",
    "description": "Algebra, or more accurately abstract algebra, extends the ideas of multiplication and addition in sets of matrices or real numbers to a more general setting.  Abstraction allows us to view the results of specific calculations in a more generic setting.  This is a core objective of pure mathematics.  It means that a single theorem can be applied in many different mathematical situations. The primary algebraic objects are groups, rings and fields and these will be the main players in the algebra part of the module.   This second module builds on the first year algebra course, extending results and producing new ideas which help us gain a deeper understanding of the algebraic structures which govern mathematics.  The fundamental notions which will be introduced are substructures, structure preserving functions and quotient structures and the course will introduce these ideas illustrating them with numerous examples. Combinatorics studies discrete mathematical structures.  These structures are very simple themselves, but they often give rise to incredibly complex problems that are beyond the capacity of current computers to solve.  Combinatorics is an essential component of many mathematical areas and also has important applications in Computer Science, Physics, Economics and Biology.The Combinatorics part of the module consists of three topics.  The first discusses advanced counting arguments, illustrating links to other areas of Mathematics.  The second consists of topics in Graph Theory.  There are many beautiful results in this area (e.g. the four colour theorem).  These results are easily accessible but often require surprising ideas.  The third topic builds on the previous two and deals with Combinatorial Algorithms and their efficiency, thus emphasizing links between Combinatorics and Computer Science.\\n"

The module then turns to look at theories explaining the spatial distribution of economic activity: It asks what is globalisation? What is regionalisation? What is meant by agglomeration, Milieux and clusters? Is it 'one world' or is the world divided into regional blocs? Is proximity important to businesses for innovation and in achieving competitive advantage?The final part of the module takes a critical overview of three different economic theories which embody a different view on how economies work. These shape economic and industrial policies needed to secure the development of businesses, economic growth, competitiveness and prosperity.

These differential equations can be either ordinary (ODEs) or partial (PDEs) and finding and interpreting their solution lies at the heart of applied mathematics.  This module develops the theory of differential equations with a particular focus on techniques of solving both linear and nonlinear ODEs.  Fourier series, which arise in the representation of periodic functions, and special functions, which arise in the solution of PDEs such as Laplace's equation that models the flow of potential, are also introduced.   A number of the classical equations of mathematical physics are solved."

The module therefore looks at both traditional and contemporary approaches to environmental economies, noting the need for decolonial approaches that promote climate based economic justice. The module explores how approaches, such as the circular economy, are developing which place the environment more central to economic calculations. Throughout the module the changing approach to sustainability within medium and large-scale firms, especially through CSR, will be explored. The module's final section is case study based and examines the above issues through the topics of water and deforestation, the aim of which is to show the interlinked nature, and complexity, of such issues on a global scale."

Students will analyse key traditions such as liberal feminism; Marxist and socialist feminism; radical feminism; care-focused feminism; postcolonial feminism; black feminism; social constructionism; and postmodern/poststructural feminism. In so doing, students will consider the issue of what constitutes feminism, and who (or what) forms the proper subject of feminist analysis. In order to reflect that feminist theory is necessarily engaged, the module will also explore both the distinctive methodological and pedagogical practices proposed by feminists and the application of theory to a range of substantive areas."

The Programme is ideal for students based overseas who would like to experience studying abroad and also gain understanding of how the molecular scale properties of pollutants affect their mobility, accumulation and remediation."

It explores the extent to which just, equitable and transparent transitions to more sustainable environmental futures can be progressed and what is possible, given the technological, political, economic and socio-cultural challenges which steps towards more sustainable practices and patterns of production and consumption must overcome. We will consider underpinning theories of governance pertaining to these transitions via different case studies of environment, energy and resources taken from majority and minority world examples; examine the geographical scales (e.g. local, national, global) of transitions, and contested governance concepts such as planetary boundaries and net zero; the processes of decision making for these transitions, and the equity and justice implications of their implementation."

It will also introduce geomorphology, which is the study of landforms and related processes at the surface of the Earth. We will study the spatial and temporal variability of hydroclimatological variables, covering local to global spatial scales and timescales from hours to centuries. We will discuss the meteorological and hydrological processes underlying these variables and the way they are linked through the water balance. We will investigate how to measure these variable with traditional in-situ techniques and with satellites. We will then introduce some important applications of this understanding, by focussing on the impacts of human-induced changes such as climate change on the water system.The geomorphology teaching will review fundamental controls on landscape systems and processes, using new and classic research. These concepts are discussed in both simple qualitative frameworks, but also using quantitative modelling approaches where numerical expressions are introduced.  These are applied to a wide range of geomorphic environments based on the current research interests of staff delivering the module."

In short, language and communication shape our humanity. It is impossible to imagine a world where no communication exists. Given its profound impact on all aspects of life, language and communication is an integral part of psychology.The topic of language and communication can be studied from many different angles, and this module will integrate insights from cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, psycholinguistics, and social psychology. While the focus is on human communication, we will also examine to what degree this is species-specific. Since language can take many different forms, we will discuss different modes of communication, e.g. aural (speech), visual (reading), visual-manual (sign language), as well as communication beyond language (gestures). In addition, we will examine how language and communication develops through the lifespan, how it is supported by the brain, and what happens when we acquire a different form of communication (e.g. when learning a second language)."

    "name": "LI Linear Algebra & Linear Programming",
    "description": "Linear algebra grew out of the development of techniques at the start of the 18th century by Leibniz, Cramer and Gauss to solve systems of linear equations.  Cayley developed matrix algebra in the middle of the 19th century and the definition of a vector space was made by Peano at the end of the 19th century, resulting in a theory of linear transformations and vector spaces in the early 20th century.  Linear algebra is not only fundamental to both pure and applied mathematics, but also has applications ranging from quantum theory to Google search algorithms. This module develops the theory of vector spaces introduced in Vectors, Geometry & Linear Algebra, covering eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials, inner products, and diagonalization.If linear algebra grew out of the solution of systems of linear equations, then linear programming grew out of attempts to solve systems of linear inequalities, allowing one to optimise linear functions subject to constraints expressed as inequalities.  The theory was developed independently at the time of World War II by the Soviet mathematician Kantorovich, for production planning, and by Dantzig, to solve complex military planning problems.  Koopmans applied it to shipping problems and the technique enjoyed rapid development in the postwar industrial boom.  The first complete algorithm to solve linear programming problems, called the simplex method, was published by Dantzig in 1947 and in the same year von Neumann established the theory of duality. In 1975, Kantorovich and Koopmans shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work and Dantzig's simplex method has been voted the second most important algorithm of the 20th century after the Monte Carlo method. Linear programming is a modern and immensely powerful technique that has numerous applications, not only in business and economics, but also in engineering, transportation, telecommunications, and planning.\\n"

    "description": "Is there any way to make a mathematics of reasoning?  If so, what would it look like?  What would be its scope, and what would be its limits?  One set of questions concern the extent to which we can adequately represent the subtleties of natural language reasoning in a regimented, mathematical language.  Another is whether we can make a system which gives all and only the right results.  We will see that we can accomplish much of what we would hope to, but not all of it.The module deals with two main formal systems, sentential logic and predicate logic. After introducing the formal languages, we characterize the logical notions of interpretation, entailment, and deducibility relative to each system. We then investigate how these notions are related, proving some fundamental metatheoretic results. In particular, we prove that both systems are sound and complete. Towards the end of the module, we will have the opportunity to discuss additional metatheoretic results, such as the incompleteness theorems."

The theory and classification of stationary points of functions of two or more variables is developed allowing maxima and minima, including those subject to constraints, to be identified.  The differential operators div, grad, curl and the Laplacian are introduced.  These are used in particular in the integral theorems (the Divergence theorem and the theorems of Green and Stokes) that relate line, surface and volume integrals and are used in the mathematical formulation of physical conservation laws.

The module progresses from a detailed description of the properties and functioning of individual neurones and synapses through to a discussion of the mechanisms underpinning functional control of CNS systems and their roles in behaviour. The impact of brain pathologies on normal function is also given substantial focus. The topics covered include: Cell and molecular biology of neurones and synapses; Cellular basis of learning and memory; Pain transmission in the CNS; CNS control of motor function (especially, motor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum) Manifestations and cellular/molecular basis of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases; Mechanisms underlying disorders of cortical functioning such as Anxiety, Depression and Schizophrenia; Therapies for many neurological/psychiatric conditions;Cellular and molecular mechanisms of drugs of abuse;Cellular and molecular aspects of the responses to trauma in the CNSThe Endocrinology and Reproduction component will provide a basic understanding of endocrine and reproductive physiology. Information is delivered on the mechanisms of hormone biosynthesis, transport, interaction with receptors, action and control. Physiology will be put into context by describing diseases related to endocrine and reproductive function. Early lectures will outline general features of endocrine physiology and these will be followed by more detailed lectures in which the function of each of the major glands will be dealt with in turn. As part of the reproduction lectures, Sex differentiation and control of developmental processes occurring during puberty will be discussed. This will be further developed by studying the function of the reproductive organs. With particular emphasis on the endocrine control of germ cell production and the processes associated with fertilisation, placental development, hormonal regulation of pregnancy, parturition and lactation. Further aspects related to current contraception and infertility treatment will also be covered in detail."

    "description": "Statistics, often regarded as distinct science rather than a branch of mathematics, is the study of data and uncertainty.  Statistical techniques allow us to make conclusions, such as whether or not living near electricity pylons is dangerous, from sets of data.  Statistics is also used in the design of effective experiments and in determining what data should be collected.  For example, statistical techniques might be used to determine the frequency with which aircraft components should be tested for safety.  Underlying these techniques is the assumption that these data are samples of a random variable that follows a probability distribution describing their behaviour. This module provides an introduction to probability and statistics.  Axiomatic probability theory, including Bayes' Theorem, is discussed briefly.  Key discrete and continuous probability modules (such as the binomial, Poisson and normal distributions) are introduced.  Properties of expectation and variance are discussed. The Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem are covered before basic statistical ideas, such as statistical inference and hypothesis testing are introduced.  Real world data are used to illustrate the theory."

Students will continue to develop an understanding of their professional identity as part of the multidisciplinary team in different work environments through direct observation of practice, work-based tasks, and guided reflection. Placements play a vital role in the professional development of pharmacy students. Pharmacy practice takes place in a wide range of settings, reflected in the diversity of experience provided to students in this component. For each placement, detailed information about learning tasks and expectations will be provided to students and their supervisors. From the perspective of the placement, this will largely be about supervision and feedback rather than teaching, but any required training (e.g., on the use of diagnostic equipment) will be specified.  Experiences will include structured activities working alongside other qualified healthcare professionals.  Students will be supported in their development by academic staff and practitioners working in partnership with pharmacy professionals and patients in both community and hospital environments.Students will demonstrate and record their achievements in their professional ePortfolio linking professional experience with all other modules and building on this in each subsequent year.Supervisors will be involved in assessing student performance (and their reflection on performance) as at expected level or below expected level, but the overall assessment of the component is managed by the programme team, based on input from supervisors across multiple placement sectors. In the hospital setting, students will be supervised by teacher / practitioner academics. In other settings, academics from the programme team will take a more active role in supporting supervisors. Every care is taken to ensure the quality and safety of learning experiences and compliance with the Code of Practice for placement learning."

In addition, the course requires students to complete mandatory training in a number of areas including safeguarding, infection control, life support and information governance.This non-credit bearing module will be used to timetable personal development sessions for students in year 2 of the Dentistry, such as academic and library skills, resilience training, personal tutoring and to encourage the development of skills critical for the students to achieve their full potential on the course. In addition, as a clinical programme, it will be used to capture clinical related material for induction and compliance and professionalism work. It is designed to develop the self-evaluation, reflective practice and study skills required of the learner in higher education through the use of inter- professional learning, small group work and structured self-directed learning. It aims to develop the skills of communication, time management and critical appraisal.To achieve those goals, content will be focused on non-module specific skills acquired during the year. This will not require any additional assessment but emphasises and rewards engagement of students with these elements. The use of a portfolio within the Clinical Assessment and Feedback System will capture longitudinal monitoring and inform progression. Furthermore, it ensures that students are not progressing with deficiencies in their skills which could put them at a significant disadvantage in the following year. Students shall normally be required to: 1. Attend, engage with and contribute to all identified compulsory teaching sessions. 2. Engage with their Personal Tutor during tutorials and reflect on the subject and transferable skills that they are developing with the aid of feedback that they have received. 3. Engage with professional / clinical responsibilities and requirements.4. Demonstrate a reflective approach to teaching and practice5. Complete the required elements of a longitudinal electronic portfolio."

Following from the 19th century prison, the module will consider a series of historical policymaking phases, including post-war 'penal welfarism' and the recent 'prison works' agendas.Second, the module will consider the varied functions that punishment performs, such as deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation, as well as investigating the liberal philosophies that underpin these ideas.Third, the module will examine within a comparative context contrasting approaches to punishment, such as Aboriginal/Maori community justice, US 'supermax' prisons and Swedish 'open' prisons.  Finally, the module will consider contemporary issues in punishment, including mass imprisonment, growth of the penal-security industrial complex, war crimes tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions."

It places the familiar techniques of differentiation, such as the Chain Rule, on a firm theoretical foundation and proves some of the key results of real analysis such as the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem and Taylor's Theorem.  The basic theory of integration on a closed bounded interval is also developed.  Differentiable functions of a single complex variable are then considered.  This study reveals a deep and fundamental theory whose development, by some of the giants of mathematics, such as Euler, Gauss, Riemann and Cauchy, began at the end of the 18th century.  This surprisingly elegant branch of mathematics, known as Complex Analysis, has many dramatic applications across mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences. It quickly provides us with powerful new techniques of integration and has far-reaching consequences in theoretical physics, electronics, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Underlying topological properties of Euclidean space common to both real and complex analysis are mentioned throughout the module.\\n"

Services are important because as consumers we use services on a daily basis and in conjunction with the importance of services to the world economy. Retailing is also fundamentally important to the UK, European and World-Wide economy. Even though the current economic climate is turbulent (e.g. the influence of Brexit), food retailing is still predicted to grow as Linthicum (2009:6) argues \u0022people still have to eat, even in an economic downturn\u0022. While many established markets have struggled in the global recession e.g. the UK there still has been significant growth across the world especially in Latin America, Middle East and India. Indeed, Euromonitor argue that these countries represent 78% of global growth. In this volatile and growing market many retailers operate globally. We will examine the challenges and opportunities that this brings by critically analysing retailers such as Disney, Starbucks, Zara, Tesco, Marks and Spencer and Carrefour.\\nThis course will examine the services and retailing industry from its beginnings to researchers' predictions for the future. Services and retailing activities are not static but in a constant state of flux. The consequence of this is that there are always new trends that consumers desire. Some recent trends include the desire for customer experiences, becoming vegan, premiumisation and trading down. We will examine how service providers and retailers can manage such trends. \\nThe focus of the course will be on understanding that not all retailers and service providers are the same and therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of different types of organisations and how marketing objectives and strategies need to be tailored to address these points. \\n"

We will be exploring planning in action and using local sites to explore some key issues as part of our planning laboratory. The module also enables students to begin to develop core skills of the planning profession \u2013 namely Geographic Information Systems. GIS are used for spatial data analysis within a wide range of industries; their use is a core skill for planners and environmental scientists.  This module will introduce students to some of the different systems which can be employed and a range of different techniques for spatial data analysis.  The emphasis will be on project work, with students learning different techniques in order to employ some of these to answer a research question of their own devising."

What is the probability that Birmingham City will win the FA Cup this season? Will it rain today? What is the probability that I will win the lottery this week? Statistical theory and methods are fundamental to our understanding of such uncertainty, and are an increasingly sought after skill. For example, Google uses statistics to improve their search algorithms; medical research uses statistics to design and analyse clinical trials evaluating whether a new cancer treatment is effective; and actuarial and economic teams use statistics to make accurate predictions about future risks and outcomes. This module presents a parallel development of statistical theory and methods, building on the introductory material in Probability & Statistics. Topics covered include classical linear models, with an introduction to the analysis of variance; basic methods for handling discrete data; further work in the theory of probability distributions; and some aspects of the theory of estimation and hypothesis testing. In the computing sessions, a statistical package is used to illustrate the application of statistical methods to the analysis of some typical data sets."

Understanding of the regulation of cell stemness by master transcription factors, the stem niche and the potential for phenotypic plasticity/transdifferentiation will be introduced. The module will provide an overview of how embryonicstem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and adult (postnatal) stem cells are isolated, generated and maintained and how signalling mechanisms, maintenance or alteration of gene profiles during this differentiation process underpins how current cell therapies have evolved. The module then leads into the key biological responses caused by DNA damage. This will develop from knowledge of chromatin structure to epigenetic modifications involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. There will also be an account of inherited human diseases resulting from deficiency in DNA damage signalling proteins. In addition, lectures on modern molecular biology techniques, such as bioinformatics, proteomics and metabolomics, are included, as well as a discussion on molecular evolution and the use of animal models. The module will use a number of integrated learning environments:  (i) Lectures will focus on cellular, molecular events, and will build on previous discussion of development, gene expression and cell signalling in Year 1 modules. A specific number of lectures focus on adult stem cells, DNA damage response, bioinformatics and act as an introduction to these areas in semester 2 and Year 3.  (ii) SGTs will reinforce lecture topics including data analysis, where focus will be on data interpretation linked to the practical elements delivered in the module. We will introduce critical thinking on research articles via a journal club format, and debate bioethics in a group format.iii) Laboratory practicals will focus on key technologies used in the field  and will act as a forum for discussing experimental design and data interpretation."

This module will feedforward and help prepare the students for their third year dissertation project in year 3 semester 2. The students will work in a group and select one area from a selection of various themes within a defined research area to develop during this module. These can include amongst others; research areas delivered within the Biomedical course, translational research skills and Enterprise and marketing, under the supervision of the Research Area Leader the students group will identify an area of research to investigate or develop a business plan to market in depth respectively. Module organisation: Research Area Leads (RALs) will be involved and each will define a research topic area. Business Area Leads (BALs) will be involved and each will define a research product areaTo each RAL or BAL a group of up to 20 students will be allocated. Allocation of module stream will be based on student preference, with each ranking the areas offered and then sorted into highest ranked group accordingly. Where oversubscription on a module occurs, students will be allocated to their next highest ranked module. With regards to students allocated to a RA, all students will be exposed to the full repertoire of research which the RAL is either directly involved in and or interested in and with assistance from the RAL each group will select a theme for further study and this will become the focus of their literature review. With regards to students allocated to a BAL, students will initially be grouped together (~4 per group) and with support and guidance from the BAL a research product area will be defined and each group will select or be allocated to one of these products. This will form the basis of the students' reflective essay on the development of a business plan.  Each student will have a supervisor for their project."

Even though students will work on their own project, they will work within groups within the laboratory. The student goal is to produce a conference-style scientific poster that they will present and defend in a symposium-like event at the end of the module, attended by peers, students and academic experts alike. Students will initially need to undertake literature searches and information gathering to understand the background of their project, enabling them to undertake experiments (a range of molecular biochemical techniques) within the lab to generate novel data to allow analysis of results and draw conclusions based on their hypotheses. All lab work will be fully supervised and will academic support will be provided in each session, enabling students to produce a high-quality research informed poster."

The students are de-briefed upon their return to the UK and invited to attend a briefing meeting with the next cohort of students going abroad. The returning students share their personal experience and provide practical tips to the outgoing cohort. This is done to establish a personal relationship between successive cohorts and enhance peers support.\\n"

In the modern era, war has several times made, remade, and at times, broken, Germany. And Germany's prosecution of war, the ideologies surrounding it along with the social, political, and cultural organization of it, has had an enormous impact not only on Germany, but on Europe and the world outside Europe. This module will explore why and how wars were fought on the territory that today is Germany; and how preparing for, fighting, and ending shaped the political, social and cultural life in Germany, Europe, and the world from the late 19th century forward to the extraordinary destruction of the Second World War.  In essence, we look at how a nation and, really, an entire continent were made and remade for war. Finally, this class also explores the understated and yet also explosive connection between war and peace in German (and so European) history."

    "description": "The Alexander Technique is an educational method that has been used for more than 100 years. It is widely taught in optimising performance in Conservatoires in the UK and globally, to musicians learning to play their instrument and performers developing voice and stage movement skill. It offers a practical means for personal change that anyone can choose to apply to their lives. In recognising and letting go of habitual stress reactions you develop skills in orienting the psycho-emotional-physical system towards health and well-being and generally in gaining more control over how to live life.  This module introduces you to the practice and key concepts of Alexander Studies and their application to everyday performance as a basis for specialist performance practice. This practice can be stage performance, teacher's classroom performance or other specialisms involving engagement with others and facilitation of groups. It begins to develop your critical and practical skills for building wellbeing into your specialism on the basis of the Technique and its particular approach to promoting wellbeing and flourishing. There is a focus is on why it is important to apply the principles of the Technique in everyday life and on how to develop a daily reflective practice which will support the demands of a career. There will be support for you to develop and refine the commitment and enjoyment, which are essential for building wellbeing into performance practice in accordance with the principles of the Technique."

    "name": "LM Approaches to Research on Discourse",
    "description": "This course addresses the discursive turn in contemporary social science research. It adopts a broad definition of `discourse' which includes an interactionist view of discourse as `situated talk' and the critical, post-structuralist view of discourse as `ways of understanding and constituting the social world'. The first view of discourse emerged as part of the broad interactional turn which took place as new fields of social science, such as conversation analysis, interactional sociolinguistics and micro-ethnography were being established (see Short Course on Researching language and literacy). Within this tradition of work, context was not taken as given but as being constituted in and through everyday discourse practices and interactional routines and therefore continually open to change and negotiation. Meanings were seen as being situated, moment by moment, in the ongoing flow of talk-in-interaction. The second view of discourse has been developed, more recently, by researchers concerned with the ways in which power relations are played out within institutions. In this body of work, the term `discourse' is often used in the plural, and discourses are seen as socially constitutive systems of meaning which are embedded in particular social, institutional and historical contexts, and 'as different ways of structuring areas of knowledge and social practice' (Fairclough, 1992:3) They are also viewed as sources of power - the power to define boundaries and categories and to construct objects and social subjects. Contemporary studies of discourse sometimes combine these two broad views of discourse. They do so in diverse ways and offer different means of conceptualising the relationship between ideological and interactional processes. The multimodal nature of communication in contemporary social life is also becoming a focus of intense research interest and has led researchers to combine perspectives from discourse studies and semiotics."

Regeneration is no exception. This module will examine the concept of community involvement in the built environment. It will look at what it means and critically examine why past attempts at involving local communities in the building and shaping of the urban environment have often failed. The module is designed to be highly participative in its nature. The teaching process has been set up to make full use of student contributions and to fully involve the participants in the actual learning process."

The module will explore the potential impact of genomic technologies on the healthcare system. Economic models will be used to demonstrate the anticipated costs and benefits of new technological approaches.\\n\\nTechnological advances in the area of genomic medicine have led to new tests with major impact on improving disease diagnosis and effectiveness of treatments. However, the continuous growth in the use of genomic technologies has cost implications. Using established economic models it is possible to predict the costs of new treatments and assess benefits to patients in the context of the available resources for health care. In addition, this module will explore the factors that determine the effects of the rapid development of genomics on health care systems covering the role and relative influence that government, doctors and the public exert in this process. These will be analysed to assess whether clients/patients are best served by current arrangements and whether people's health outcomes match reasonable expectations.

Emphasis will initially be given to the analysis of the time series properties of asset returns, such as fat tails and skewness, and dynamic properties, for example volatility clustering and long memory, will be investigated. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) will be used as the foundation of the equilibrium pricing of financial assets. The discount factor, Generalised Methods of Moments and state-space language are considered in the context of the beta, mean-variance, and regression language common in empirical work and earlier theory.

Examining a range of works of art, design and film, as well as textual sources, it explores the ways in which some of the defining practices and theories of Modernism revolving around technology, mass culture, and sexuality can be used to understand attitudes towards the body. The module will focus in particular on the representation of the body and;warfare in relation to debates around prosthetics and war neurosis;technology and capitalist modes of production and consumption;free body culture: nudity, dance and sport;sexual identity through the pioneering work of German Sexologists. In order to consider such discourses, this module will analyse several art historical moments associated with German Modernism (including Neue Sachlichkeit, Dada and late German Expressionism).  Artists such as Otto Dix, George Grosz, Willi Baumeister, Jeanne Mammen and Martha Hegemann, amongst others, will be examined.  As well as developing an understanding of the body as a site of complex social and psychological negotiations, students will be encouraged to engage critically with both historical (Freud, Hirschfeld, Schlemmer) and more contemporary (Foucault, Mosse, Cowan) theoretical considerations of the body in order to frame their interpretations of art works. Through emphasis on the body, students will also be asked to question the lasting myth of Weimar Germany as the period of the 'Golden Twenties' (Gay, Laqueur, Willet), as well as the unproblematic image of German culture as founded on a teleological model 'cut short' by the National Socialists."

The module examines case studies that illustrate the global impact on art of European colonialism, as well as examples from the period 1945 to the present, including both cold war avant-gardes and more recent post-1989 tendencies. Case studies may also include museum and gallery practices in relation to global art.Through the formative assessment, the student will exhibit advanced proficiency in oral skills."

    "description": "This module will explore theories surrounding the intersection of migration, citizenship and globalisation. It offers a critical overview of academic scholarship in migration studies paying particular attention to the policies and politics that shape responses to migration at international, EU, national, and local levels.  It will challenge students to think critically about migration and the impact upon public policy and to examine reactions and responses to migration from a range of contrasting perspectives. This module will enrich the offer on the MA in Migration, Superdiversity and Policy providing an advanced module in which to explore in greater depth the intersections of policy, international migration and societal transformation. The MA in Migration currently includes only one migration-related module. In the current programme issues of migration are touched upon but mainly addressed in relation to new migration and within the national context. This module places the relationship between migration and citizenship at its core and explores shifting understanding of belonging in Western liberal democracies as well as in new immigration hubs. It explores the impact of this relationship on ideas of deservingness, entitlement and access to public services and social welfare.It is critical that our MA in Migration and other MA programmes offer module options that reflect both cutting-edge academic debates as well as policy and legislative developments in this area. Given its global scope, the proposed module will also enhance our MA offer to international students and further enrich the study offer for students who come to the University of Birmingham, located within one of the most multicultural cities in the UK, to learn about all aspects of Social Policy including diversity and migration. It would provide an advanced option on migration issues for the MA in Global Social Policy currently under discussion.The module is likely to be of interest to students enrolled on programmes in other departments across the University e.g. Sociology, Social Psychology, Planning, History, Law, Politics, Human Geography. The module leader and the Director of the MA have had numerous conversations with key contacts in other departments, particularly those linked to the Institute for Research into Superdiversity. and are currently finalising a list of MA programmes where the course will be offered as a MOMD."

The relationship between the internal labour and external markets and human resource development practice is explained. The changing nature of the relationship between internal and external labour market as countries develop and industrialise is explored, as is the role of national Vocational Educational and Training (VET) and national human resource development (NHRD) strategies. Having considered the influence of national VET/NHRD patterns, the module focuses on the instruments of HRD within the public service, identifying and analysing the specific challenges and complicating factors of civil service HRD and how the policy responses to these have altered in recent years, Case studies from a range of countries, primarily China and India, are considered in order to analyse the interaction between internal and external (national and international) labour markets, national cultures and international trends in VET/NHRD policies and institutional practices in HRD in the public sector."

This module will discuss the emergence of HRM in the US and UK as a response to the competitive pressures facing \u0022western\u0022 firms in the 1980s. The concept remains ambiguous, i.e., what HRM encompasses remains open to discussion. Notwithstanding this, the module will critically evaluate several of the people management policies most commonly associated with HRM. It will also deal with a more recent strand of the scholarly debate that questions the actual way in which HRM works to enhance the competitive advantage of the firm as its advocates claim."

During the modern period the interior constituted more than a mere backdrop to visual representation.  It was the active subject of artistic and other forms of visual and textual culture and increasingly the object of design practice and its attendant representations.  Moreover, the interior was considered a metaphor for self, so the issues of subjective and corporeal interiority will be considered at length, as will issues deriving from feminist methodologies. We will consider a range of media, including painting, magazines and the novel; debate the practices of key art and design figures including Edgar Degas, Edouard Vuillard, Henri Matisse, Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand and analyse the interiors produced by the Nabis, Cubism and Surrealism.  The module considers visual forms in relation to textual forms including artistic and architectural theory, popular psychology, and literary fiction by J.K.

You will critically examine development theories and how they have been, and are, applied in the areas of economic, social and political development. You will also have the opportunity to apply these critical approaches to two case studies of contemporary development concern. The module is designed to give you a solid introduction to the key aspects of the topic that will serve as the analytical basis for much of the rest of your masters studies. A number of the issues are dealt with in more detail in other modules. In addition, you may want to pursue some of the themes in your dissertation. The module is divided into three parts. After an introductory lecture, Part 1 explores theories of development in historical context from (roughly) 1945 up to the present. Part 2 examines theory through the lenses of economic, social and political development. Part 3 is an opportunity to apply this development thinking to the real world through the study of contemporary case studies. Throughout, the emphasis is on your developing a critical understanding of the evolution of development theories over the last half-century and its implications for present day thinking about development."

Teaching staff will be drawn from Inlogov, HSMC and the accompanying UoM.Topics will be selected on the basis that they will appeal to both sets of students. For example the expertise of the UoM School of Government on co-production will be of great interest to UK students with an interest in how to expand coproductive approaches to health and local government. The UK's pioneering work around priority-setting will be of interest to the Melbourne students. Teaching will run across 5 days as is the norm for Inlogov and HSMC modules.

Especially when working with observational data, researchers miss crucial information for making causal interpretations of statistical associations. This module will explore under which circumstances and subject to which assumptions, researchers can interpret estimated associations as causal with substantially higher confidence.\\n\\nThe module sessions will explore (1) theories of causality and the potential outcome framework; (2) the fundamental problem of causal inference and its possible solutions; (3) causal relationships and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); (4) 'selection on observables' identification strategies; and (5) 'selection on unobservables' identification strategies.   \\n\\nThe goal of this module is to give students a comprehensive toolbox for reading and producing cutting-edge statistical research. The module will also act as a complement to modules teaching methods for statistical inference and as a springboard for students wishing to gain more specific quantitative research methods training via other modules from within the Advanced Training Modules suite.  \\n"

    "description": "Since the end of the twentieth century, New Media has transformed our lives and the way we communicate. Not only has the internet and text messaging impacted on the language we use \u2013 for example in the form of 'txtspk' \u2013 but digital technologies also shape how we interact with those around us, as well as allowing 'globally-dispersed' communities to form as people online rally around shared interests, political causes and common goals. However, for many people \u2013 teachers, parents, community leaders \u2013 new communications technology also sparks serious concerns and raises troubling questions. Should we worry about 'txtspk' and the effect it has on children's literacy? What impact is the internet having on traditional community networks and our sense of the social? How are Wikipedia, websites and blogs altering notions of authority and what it means to be an author? And is the internet bolstering the global dominance of English at the expense of minority languages? This module looks at how these public fears can be addressed using tools and theories of applied linguistics, through their application in seminars to naturally-occurring online texts. It explores, for example, the principles and patterns behind unconventional online spellings, the use and significance of multimodal resources, what it means to be literate in an online, connected world, and the nature and function of online social networks. It also asks how online data can be collected and exploited, and whether existing frameworks of analysis can unproblematically be transferred online. By the end of this module, students will have studied a range of current online contexts \u2013 from websites and wikis to texting and Twitter - and will be equipped to consider the implications and issues that arise within the rapidly-changing virtual world."

In terms of the law, the module focuses particularly on the primary legislation: the Children Act 1989, the key amendments to this piece of legislation and subsequent additional Acts. Students will therefore be expected to be able to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Children Act 1989. Alongside this, the module will consider and critique changes and developments in the statutory guidance (including Working Together) and the debates and shifts in the political, intellectual and policy landscape of contemporary child protection policy. In so doing reference will be made to other jurisdictions and inter-agency working. Although the focus is on the law as it relates to child protection in England, the mdoule recognises that some students may work in different jurisdictions.  Where this is so, opportunities will be available to contrast the relevant legilation and policies in the students's jurisdiction with those in England."

    "name": "LM Law, Society and Governance",
    "description": "The objective of this module is to explore relationships between law, society and governance from an international and comparative perspective.  The module addresses some of the challenges facing contemporary societies \u2013 e.g., technological and data growth and inequality, rising poverty, socio-economic inequalities, global crime, depletion of natural resources, climate crisis, armed conflict \u2013 and explores the possibilities and limitations of law to resolve them at the national, international and transnational levels. The module considers the role of governance at this intersection between law and society, examining the processes through which state and non-state actors interact to design and/or implement legal frameworks and policies to address social challenges. In doing so, the module seeks to prompt a critical examination of the differences and similarities between law and governance, as well as the possibility of conflict and mutual reinforcement between them. It also reflects on the growing challenges facing state-centric legal regimes, such as public law or international law, in providing solutions in contexts where non-state actors are increasingly influential.  The module engages with these issues by examining the interactions of non-state actors, state authorities and international organisations that have a mandate over the aforementioned social challenges \u2013 e.g., the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labour Organisation, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, regional and international human rights bodies.  The module draws on a combination of socio-legal studies, doctrinal and governance studies."

It includes evaluating personal leadership impact and how individual agency and organisational effort can be developed for improved outcomes. Throughout the module attention is paid to the importance of both the process (how leadership and change is enacted) and the anticipated outcomes of change (what difference is achieved). The module draws on lessons from the literature and the practical experience of those leading and delivering health and social care services."

In most cases clinical leaders are hybrids, maintaining senior roles in both clinical practice and management. The context for clinical leadership needs to take account of professional roles, relationships, and regulation, and the processes of leadership are often understood to be different than 'general' leadership, because of the autonomous nature of clinical practice (which varies between professions), the collegial nature of professions, but also the strong hierarchical relationships within training programmes. The role of clinical professionals in management teams will also be considered, where professionals often have detailed knowledge of and accountability for care processes that others may lack, although often without formal authority within the organisational setting. The literature relevant to this module is spread around a number of disciplines, including management, health services research, organisational studies, and sociology, and the implications of this for developing a clinical leadership evidence-base will be explored."

The GPhC standards for pharmacy professionals will be at the core of the course with each student working towards the standard expected of a newly registered pharmacist.  Each student will be required to pass both evidence requirements of the GPhC and the University of Birmingham before the pre-registration year can be completed.  Students will be expected to demonstrate their ability to record, reflect upon and evaluate their personal effectiveness as a pharmacist.  The student's ability to communicate with patients, colleagues and other healthcare professionals must also be shown in their recorded evidence. \\n\\nStudents will be supported through face to face contact with their pre-registration tutor, together with an academic pre-registration manager who will monitor their progress.  Students will engage with mandatory regular university based study days & workshops and will also be supported through online resources. \\n\\nIn order for students to complete registration with the GPhC they must pass the GPhC registration examination.

It sounds simple, but in reality policy making is a complex process, with competing interests trying to influence the agenda and design of solutions, with those with more power and resources more likely to influence policy. A wide range of strategies are used by those seeking to influence policy, making it important to understand how a policy process works and which strategies are best to use to gain influence. This module is essential for those students working in government, or intending to work in government, and playing a role in making, implementing and/or evaluating policy. It is also essential for those who hope to play a role in influencing policy, whether that's through an NGO, a campaign group or a think tank. You will gain knowledge of policy-making and skills in making, analysing and influencing policy that will be of real use to you in the policy world. The emphasis of the module is on the process of making policy, rather than on the content. Key concepts associated with policy analysis are introduced to analyse the process of policy-making, providing students with: a better understanding of how policies are made; an appreciation of the complexity of the policy process; familiarity with key factors that limit the government's ability to achieve its goals; and the ability to identify links between the various levels of constraints facing policy makers."

In doing so, it takes students into the first steps of understanding the context within which their services are situated, and asks them to look beyond the immediate services and organisation. This will enable them to examine and explore the wider system, evaluating and making use of a diverse range of information and viewpoints, including understanding the regional, national, international and multi-cultural contexts and drivers for change and service improvement. This sets the scene for a multi-faceted examination of the structures, processes, behaviours, culture and patient experiences of the services that \\ntheir team leaders lead, and their work with them to understand how, collectively, they can improve the quality of care and patient experience.  \\n"

Recent debates over a new history curriculum in schools and the memory of the Great War suggest the difficulties of providing an overarching interpretative framework for understanding modern Britain. As politicians and policy-makers grapple with the need for national narratives, it becomes more important for us as historians to engage with such projects whenever possible. How do we write history that remains intellectually inclusive, avoids privileging historic and contemporary historiographical concerns and creates conversations that cut across regional, temporal and disciplinary boundaries?  What should this kind of history take as its focus, subject matter, scope and methodology? New Directions in Modern Studies will introduce you to a series of important historical works that have stimulated new visions of the past and its role in public life, and set out new ways of thinking about the practice of history. If British society, culture, and politics has changed over the period covered by this module, then so have the way that historians have approached and conceptualized it, the subjects they have address, and the methods they have used.

    "description": "Many decision problems arising in managerial decision making in the public as well as in the private sector are inherently nonlinear, and the same holds for various problems occurring in science and engineering. Tackling highly realistic nonlinear problems leads to solution methods totally different from those of, say, linear programming. In this course, the essential ideas as well as some of the most important solution algorithms for nonlinear decision problems are studied.Most problems from management mathematics (discrete or continuous) are NP-hard. In other words, optimisation problems that arise in industry or in the public sector could not be solved exactly in reasonable computing time, even with modern computers. Therefore, when traditional mathematics techniques fail to give a fast answer, one should rely on near-optimal solution methods or heuristics. Ideas of classical heuristics (local search, hill climbing, greedy search, divide and conquer, A* search, dynamic programming etc.) will be studied first. A modern heuristics (metaheuristics) or general frameworks for building heuristics, usually gives rules of escaping from the so-called 'local optima trap'. Such methods are Tabu search, Simulated Annealing, Evolutionary Algorithms, Genetic Algorithms etc."

The module will show students the wide organisational scope of Operations Management activity and will establish an understanding of the core concepts underlying the discipline. The module is introductory in nature, and while focussed primarily on large organisations, also looks at small organisations and even the management of individual \u0022human\u0022 processes. The module is intended as an introduction to operations management in both service and manufacturing organisations. Its intention is to provide the building blocks of those principles, which are broadly applicable to most organisations. The module will introduce the principles of the \u0022lean\u0022 operation, and show how managers can adopt lean principles in practice."

In some of these post-conflict settings, political actors can overcome societal divisions and work towards sustainable political and economic recovery. In others, however, peace and development remain elusive. These countries become caught in a conflict trap and experience recurrent civil war.What explains this variation in post-conflict reconstruction and development? And how can local political elites and international actors keep the peace, re-build the state, and reconstruct communities? This module explores these questions through an in-depth examination of peace stabilization and consolidation approaches. The former approach includes measures and interventions aimed at sustaining negotiated settlements. The latter covers strategies to reconstruct and develop state institutions, communities, and individuals.The module is designed to introduce students to key concepts and theories in the study of civil war and development using a wide range of empirical examples of post-conflict settings from across the developing world. This will enable students to assess the promises and pitfalls of common policy interventions for post-conflict reconstruction and development."

Q methodology is a set of research design principles and techniques that allows for a systematic and scientific understanding of subjectivity.  The methodology was originally developed by William Stephenson in the 1950s and used for identifying market segments in advertising and communications.  For social science, Q methodology offers a means of systematically identifying the range of distinctive subjective standpoints in a given context.  Being systematic and interpretive is Q methodology is well suited to postgraduate research either as a standalone research design or offering an injection of systematicity to interview based research or an interpretive supplement to aid survey instrument design.  In what is an interactive and hands-on workshop, participants will develop an understanding of the basic principles of Q research design and process from identifying the volume of debate, developing statements, administering a Q sort, conducting and interpreting results using dedicated software.  By the end of the workshop, participants will posses the ability to design, administer and interpret a Q methodology research project."

Example data will be used to explore these estimation methods. The emphasis in the practical component will be on the application of appropriate techniques and interpreting results using secondary data and the interpretation of results. The course assumes that students have prior knowledge of common commands in Stata to organise and handle data and undertake standard regression techniques. By the end of the two days students should have a good understanding of how to run their own regressions with categorical dependent variables using Stata and how to interpret their results."

Divisive social conflict and communal violence have resulted from this mobilization, challenging conventional secular notions of national identity and political community. This module asks a series of important questions: How have nationalist, developmental and democratic agendas in the post-colonial era contributed to the emergence of assertive, contentious religious identities? How have religious beliefs, communities, and historical memories been transformed by this mobilization? In what ways have these visions of religious nationalism transformed political, economic and social dynamics? We will examine a variety of cases to give greater substantive understanding and analytical focus. An indicative but not exhaustive range of examples are the Hindutva and communal violence in India, Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar, and ethno- Islamic radicalism and pogroms in Indonesia, gender and sexual violence of Catholic nationalism in Poland, and the ethno-religious civil war in the Balkans."

In outline, the following foci are envisaged (anticipating approximately one day on each with an emphasis on seminar rather than formal lecture format):\\n1. Context and issues\\nConceptualisation of disability and impact on resesearch epistemology;\\nDiverse approaches to research in the area of disability, incouding participatory and emancipatory approaches;\\nThe nascent 'disability history' agenda;\\nThe politicisation of SEN/disability and policy oriented research;\\nEvaluation research in disability or special needs\\n2.Ethics and methods:\\nEthical issues e.g.gaining informed consent with participants having limited communication skills;\\nDifferentiating access and response modes for participants with cognitive or sensory impairments (including arts and web based methods);\\nChild voice in the context of children with disabilities or special needs;\\nDissemination: access and format issues; involving people with disabilities in dissemination"

    "description": "Social researchers in a number of disciplines have inquired into the lives of young people, producing representations of youth and young people of interest to governments, the media, parents, and professional groups, as well as young people themselves. Youth is a site of theoretical debate, social control and repeated moral panic, and the production of representations through research has often shaped perceptions and treatment of young people, though not always to their benefit. Young people typically lack the power of adult subjects to participate in the production of social research or contest the findings and use of research about them. As such, researching the lives of young people involves specific methodological and ethical considerations.\\n\\nBy the end of this module, students will be able to: \\n- critically discuss social research interest in youth and young people, identifying and describing the main disciplinary traditions of research into the lives of young people, in terms of: i) age-specific institutions and social spaces and the particular nature of young people's participation in those spaces \\nSocial policy that affects and defines youth, including national and global policy discourses; ii) transition from childhood and to adulthood, as conditioned by social structural conditions; iii) Power-relations to peer and adult subjects, including researchers, taking account of the intersections of youth with other identity categories.\\n\\n- take account of the ethical issues associated in engaging young people in social research within research design strategies and practices. Ethical issues will include the legal, policy and practical aspects of accessing and working with young people, and issues of the participation and representation of a relatively powerless group in research. \\n\\n- discuss the application of established social research methods in research with young people, such as the use of participatory and action research approaches, interviews, ethnography, visual methods, online and social media spaces, and cohort studies.  \\n\\nFor the summative assessment, students will critically evaluate a piece of published account of a social research project that has a substantial focus on the participation of young people. Students' critique should focus primarily on issues related to youth and young people, which can include theoretical accounts of youth, as well as issues of power, participation and ethics involved in carrying out the research, producing the analysis and writing up and presenting the work. They will be expected to take account of the wider methodological literature on researching the lives of young people. Students will then describe how principles or approaches used in this research, or derived from critique of this research, might be applied in the student's own research.\\n"

This module investigates how organisms detect and respond to variable environments, including anthropogenic (human-made) change, and reviews the different molecular signalling pathways and physiological mechanisms underpinning adaptation to changing conditions.  Examples are provided from a range of organisms, but with a specific focus on plants and insects. Case studies highlight different research techniques employed in examining responses to environmental change, as well as how to potentially manipulate these responses in order to develop mitigation strategies/enhance resilience at species, population and ecosystem levels, as well as for food security.The main aims of this module are to provide students with information, guidance, and access to resources, that will allow them to:(a) Gain an in-depth understanding of how organisms respond and adapt to changes in their environment.(b) Recognize that the term \u0022environment\u0022 covers a continuum of spatial scales from molecular environments within cells, to broad-scale geographic environments and climatic zones.(c) Appreciate that adaptation to environmental change for an individual organism is transient and occurs across a temporal spectrum of seconds to seasons.  For species, adaptation is long-term, but not fixed/permanent, and occurs across a timescale of generations. (d) Interpret the potential impact of climate change on species (including crops), communities and ecosystems, as well as the provision of food security.(e) Become effective independent learners, capable of interpreting and critically analysing the scientific literature to help formulate and express their own ideas and develop mitigation strategies against the negative impacts of climate change and extreme environments."

This module will investigate the ways in which such 'bodies of knowledge' are dramatized corporeally through a range of disciplines, including anatomy and dissection; theories of gender; teratology (the study of 'monstrosity'); natural history; witchcraft and demonology; heraldry and commemoration; post-humanism and early robotics; colonial discourse; and others. Through these disciplines Shakespeare's bodies stage their own liminality, and are shown to inhabit the spaces between life and death; remembering and forgetting; the natural and the supernatural; the human and the monstrous; the corporeal and the technological; the masculine and the feminine; and old worlds and new.Using a range of historical, contextual and illustrative material \u2013 from spectacular funerary monuments to anatomical manuals; from the archaeological remains of magic to the wonder literature of early modern monstrosity; from communal rituals of bodily humiliation to early modern automata and robotics \u2013 we'll plunge into the hidden recesses of the Renaissance body to reveal how Shakespeare's art was influenced by advances in the study of dissection, changes in the understanding of natural and cosmological histories, developments in early theories of birth and gender formation, prevailing anxieties surrounding witchcraft, trends in the rituals of burial and commemoration, the politics of the tortured body, beliefs and misconceptions attached to race, the impact of new-world exploration, and much more!Our aim will be to gain new and compelling insights into Shakespeare's bodies as they perform the systems of knowledge which generate their meanings at the very nexus of material, textual and performative cultures."

This is a very practical module designed for practising teachers. It demonstrates that a syllabus is a lot more than simply a list of items at the start of a handbook.  The module demonstrates that a syllabus typically reflects:-\\tbeliefs about language and how language works-\\tbeliefs about how we learn, or maybe acquire a language-\\tthe way culture influences teaching and learning situationsThe module introduces students to a variety of different types of syllabus such as the traditional grammatical syllabus, the lexical syllabus, the functional-notional syllabus, and the task-based syllabus.

That is, whether it is legitimate to value or disvalue a person on the basis of their aesthetic qualities. With this question at the heart of the module, we will consider a nexus of further philosophical questions at the intersection of ethics and aesthetics, with an eye for their application in the politically charged arena of interpersonal life. The material with which we will engage is drawn from a range of traditions including, for example, some contemporary debates in anglophone ethics, feminist theory, the phenomenological tradition, and contemporary aesthetics."

For this 20-credit module, topics focus on two areas and the relationship between them: 1. concerning violence, political power, and security as the concern of democratic states; and 2.  concerning violence against states by subjects and other non-state entities in the form of armed political resistance, revolutionary violence, and non-state terrorism. Seminars begin with philosophical and conceptual questions concerning the problems of defining 'terrorism,' the concept of violence and its relationship with concepts of injustice, and the role of violence as an `instrument\u00bf in politics. These are followed by a series of discussions on the nature and scope of rightful resistance in contexts of acute political oppression, the debate on whether 'terrorism' is ever justified, the problem of interrogational torture in response to terrorist 'emergencies', and the legal and moral arguments for targeted killing of known terrorists. Some Key QuestionsWhat is `terrorism\u00bf? Is it distinct from other uses of violence such as 'freedom fighting' or conventional war?Is the use of terrorism ever morally permissible or excusable?What, if any, political values can legitimate the use of violence and under what circumstances?What is the relationship between violence and political power?Under what circumstances are armed resistance and revolution permissible?Is interrogational torture by democratic states ever justified or excusable in response to terrorist threats?Is the targeted killing of terrorists an acceptable security measure from an ethical or legal point of view?"

The module consists of eight units:1) Introduction to Translation Pedagogy2) Translator Training: from Market Needs to Teaching Resources3) Translator Training: from Teaching Activities to Course Evaluation4) Language Teaching for Trainee Translators: Approach, Design, Procedure5) Translation Teaching for Language Learners: Approach6) Translation Teaching for Language Learners: Design and Procedure7) Language Teaching and Translation: Approach8) Language Teaching and Translation: Design and Procedure Unit 1 gives an overview of the diverse educational contexts where translator and/or interpreter skills are taught, i.e. undergraduate and postgraduate programmes that aim to prepare professional translators; dedicated translation modules that form part of the curricular design of modern languages degree programmes; language modules at undergraduate and graduate level where translation is used as an effective means of developing communicative and intercultural competences alongside other learning and assessment tools.Unit 2 deals with the most general aspects of curricular design in translator training, i.e. market needs, aims and objectives, student needs, course content, teaching resources.Unit 3 deals with more specific aspects of curricular design in translator training, i.e. teaching activities, assessment tasks, course evaluation.Unit 4 analyses the methods employed in language teaching for trainee translators, using a three-level model, where method is theoretically related to approach, it is organizationally determined by design and is practically realised in procedure.Unit 5 and 6 examine the approach, design and procedure adopted in dedicated translation modules that form part of the education of modern languages students.Unit 7 and 8 examine the approach, design and procedure adopted by language teaching methods that use translation as an additional learning and assessment tool."

It introduces students to the ways in which manuscripts were made and what we can learn from them about the past as material objects. It will examine the social and political value that these often lavishly illustrated productions had for aristocratic patrons like the Burgundian dukes. It will consider the role of images in books in relation to the texts, as beyond simple 'illustration'. Through consideration of inventories and original books themselves, it will also look at how manuscripts and printed books functioned in the everyday lives of ordinary people, as repositories of prayer, important dates, and mnemonic images. The module will also examine the fate of medieval and early modern books in the nineteenth century, and the policies/politics of libraries in the twentieth and twenty-first. The module will draw closely on the collections in the Cadbury Research Library and encourage students to engage with the numerous online archives available through institutions such as the British Library, John Rylands Library, and the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale. Students will therefore not only gain a familiarity with pre-modern sources, but will also be encouraged to engage critically with questions relating to changing notions of use, conservation, research and access."

This includes: leading policy and strategic school-wide developments pertaining to SEN and/or disability issues; the identification and promotion of best practice; ensuring compliance with statutory responsibilities; supporting staff to achieve positive working relations with pupils with SEN and/ or disabilities and their parents/carers.\\n\\nLeadership and development of staff\\nThis aspect of the module focuses on the role of the SENCO in identifying and providing appropriately differentiated professional development opportunities for staff (e.g. for newly qualified teachers, teaching assistants and other adults in education support roles). It also examines the use of professional standards (e.g. for teachers and higher level teaching assistants) as a means to developing staff knowledge, skills and understanding in relation to SEN and/or disability. The purpose and value of a range of staff development approaches will also be discussed, including coaching, mentoring, and the identification and coordination of appropriate internal/external opportunities for training. This discussion will be informed by research evidence related to school based professional development and impact factors.\\n\\nWorking collaboratively with external agencies\\nThe capacity to assume responsibility (leading, developing, and supporting) for accessing key sources of external support and expertise (e.g. local authority learning/impairment specific services; special school outreach; social/health service professionals; voluntary organisations) is a key part of the SENCO's role. This aspect of the module examines the concept and practice of multi-agency and partnership working (e.g. through the use of the common assessment framework and 'team around the child' approaches; through systematic collaboration with Connexions or other professionals advising/supporting transfer and transition for pupils with SEN and/or disabilities). It also discusses the interpretation and use of specialist information (e.g. advice provided in reports by educational psychologists or speech and language therapists).\\n\\nWorking in partnership with pupils and families\\nEnsuring pupils with SEN and/or disabilities - regardless of their level of need - are involved in key aspects of the provision made for them. This aspect of the module identifies ways in which SENCOs can support this kind of participation (e.g. through individual education planning; involvement in annual reviews; decision-making about the use of 'withdrawal' approaches to teaching or the way that of other services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy or speech, language and communication therapy are accessed by pupils).\\n\\nCommunicating effectively with parents/carers, taking account of their views and providing them with timely and relevant information is also a critical part of the SENCO's role. This aspect of the module introduces concepts of both participation and partnership, providing opportunities for critical appraisal with reference to theory and practice."

Second, it identifies strategic dimensions of the SENCO's role (critical appreciation). Third, it considers the use of appropriate tools, for collecting, analysing and applying data with a view to improving the learning of pupils with SEN and/or disabilities. Fourth, it examines the role that a range of school based professionals have to play in supporting pupils with SEN and/or disabilities, including 'designated' support staff who work with this group of pupils.\\nProfessional context\\nThe module reviews the statutory and regulatory framework for inclusive and special education, outlining and analysing legislation and policy at local and national levels. It also summarises current and pending laws and associated guidance on disability equality. \\nStrategic development of SEN policy and procedure\\nThis aspect of the module seeks to support SENCOs to carry out their strategic roles effectively, with particular reference to senior leaders in schools and school governing bodies. It helps SENCOs to play in a key role in policy development and school improvement planning (e.g. through the use of institutional self-evaluation (e.g. the 'Self Evaluation Framework' used by schools, local authorities, other educational organisations and Ofsted). It also identifies procedures designed to ensure the effectiveness of provision for pupils with SEN and/or disabilities.  Effectiveness is also considered from a financial perspective. SENCOs are introduced to local authority and other 'value for money' evidence tools and how these can be used to make the best use of available resources to plan, evaluate and improve provision for pupils with SEN and/or disabilities.  The last part of this aspect of the module focuses on the use of policy and research evidence to improve outcomes for pupils with SEN and/or disabilities. It also addresses barriers to participation and learning, identifying how these can reduced or removed through the use of active policies and procedures, and how technology can support teaching and learning (e.g. in relation to physical, sensory and communication impairments).\\nUsing tools for collecting, analysing and using data\\nEstablished and emergent tools for collecting, analysing and using data (e.g. national RAISEonline; a range of local authority and school data sets) will be outlined and critically appraised in relation to national, local and school specific contexts. The use of data to raise expectations, and to improve the learning of pupils with SEN and/or disabilities, for example, through effective target setting, will be discussed with reference research evidence. \\nDeploying staff and managing resources\\nStaff deployment and the management of resources will be discussed in relation to national policy initiatives and significant research evidence. Particular attention will be given to: appropriate task delegation; the effective/flexible deployment of teaching assistants, higher level teaching assistants and other support staff, making use of particular strengths and expertise of individuals.\\n\\n\\n\\n"

    "description": "This module starts by developing the theory of continuous and differentiable functions of one real variable introduced in Real Analysis and the Calculus.  It places the familiar techniques of differentiation, such as the Chain Rule, on a firm theoretical foundation and proves some of the key results of real analysis such as the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem and Taylor's Theorem.  The basic theory of integration on a closed bounded interval is also developed.\\n\\nDifferentiable functions of a single complex variable are then considered.  This study reveals a deep and fundamental theory whose development, by some of the giants of mathematics, such as Euler, Gauss, Riemann and Cauchy, began at the end of the 18th century.  This surprisingly elegant branch of mathematics, known as Complex Analysis, has many dramatic applications across mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences. It quickly provides us with powerful new techniques of integration and has far-reaching consequences in theoretical physics, electronics, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. \\n\\nUnderlying topological properties of Euclidean space common to both real and complex analysis are mentioned throughout the module."

Traditionally the study of political science and international relations has framed the understanding of religion within the context of secularisation and the nation-state. This interpretation is being increasingly contested by the impact of globalisation and the rise of anti-secular movements. The module will critically examine the secularisation thesis as applied to the 'West' (developed countries) and the 'East' (underdeveloped countries) and evaluate the impact of globalisation on collective religious identities.Following an introduction to the theoretical perspectives the course will focus on three particular themes:Religious NationalismWhat explains the rise of religious nationalism in South Asia (India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) and militant Islam Middle-East? How do we account for the decline of 'secular' nationalism in developing countries? Religious Identities and Mobilisation Are religious identities easier to politically mobilise than non-religious identities? How can we explain the success of the religious right in the US? Religious Transnationalism Religious identities play a significant role in the politics of transnational groups. How has globalisation impacted on religious transnationalism? The module concludes by reflecting on the wider implications for the study of politics and international relations of organised religious movements today."

    "name": "Year 2 Hospital Preparation Course",
    "description": "The year 2 Hospital Preparation Course is designed to help students make an effective transition to hospital-based clinical learning.  Prior to year 3 students spend the majority of their time at the university.  From year 3 onwards students spend most of their time in hospital.  This requires students to acquire a new set of learning strategies and skills.  Historically many students have struggled in making this adjustment, and have made a slower than may be hoped start to year 3.  This component aims to help students understand what is required of them and introduce them to their placement hospital.  Students then have the summer break to reflect on the experience.  When they return it will be to a place they know, and this should help reduce anxiety.This placement also ensures students have a thorough induction to their first placement, including such things as fire training and data protection."

    "name": "Year 3 Professional Development Activities",
    "description": "The Professional Development Activities (PDA) required component of MBChB 3 is designed to build on the structured professional development which students have gained throughout the first two years of their course. There is no summative assessment. Students will need to evidence due diligence in the PDA, measured by attendance registers and submission of a personal development form, in order to progress to MBChB 4. The PDA provides students at the end of their first full time year of clinical medicine with an opportunity to explore several key themes, which will operate as a menu which students can choose from.\\n\\nFirst, students will update themselves on professional and legal guidance which has been issued since they completed the formal teaching of these subjects in Year 2 of the course. This will emphasise the need for professionals to maintain their own professional learning requirements.\\n\\nSecond, providing guided independent study via e-learning will allow students to develop the skill of independent learning and professional development in a structured way, which will equip them for completely independent learning later in the course and throughout their career.\\n\\nThird, students will select a skills workshop from an extensive list of choices. Some of these workshops cover challenging areas in clinical practice including interaction with patients lacking mental capacity, those with various beliefs and sexual orientation, and refugees.  This helps develop the talent of identify learning needs for future clinical years. In addition, they will have the opportunity to select a personal interest activity, from a list of choices, and get in contact with experts to comprehend how professional skills and attitudes can be fostered. These choices will be outside of those conventionally available in a standard medical curriculum such as learning from experts in military and sports medicine, and clinical managers.\\n\\nFourth, students will have the opportunity to spend 4-5 working days at schools interacting with pupils of age group 5-11years. This aims primarily at empowering and increasing students' confidence in interacting with children so that improving their interaction and communication in the clinical environment.\\n"

    "name": "Year 5 Student Assistantship",
    "description": "All medical students who remain in the UK after graduation will begin their medical career as a Foundation Grade doctor.  The transition from being medical students to foundation doctors can be a cause for considerable anxiety, and one for which students will not have invested enough practical thought, as they will, right until the final examinations be engaged in learning that helps them pass the MBChB, rather than specifically focussing on learning for their first job.   This component takes place after the final exams, and pairs students with foundation doctors to allow the students the opportunity to gain a good insight into the role of the foundation doctor, but also to give the student the opportunity to reflect on their preparedness for the role, and to engage in any learning or practical skills development, which may not have been covered sufficiently for the individual student during the MBChB."
